Individuals also funneled $79 billion into indexed annuities in 2022, an annual record, according to LIMRA, an insurance industry group.

Its proposal would subject financial advisors and others who work with retirement investors to a \u201cfiduciary\u201d legal standard under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, according to administration officials.\nThe Labor Department also tried to rewrite so-called fiduciary rules during the Obama administration.

The problem is, you can\u2019t count on it as a strategy.\nSuch people continue to get a regular paycheck, so don\u2019t have to live off their savings. Meanwhile, they have extra time to save and for their assets to (hopefully) grow. Further, they can likely delay claiming Social Security benefits, guaranteeing a higher monthly payout for the rest of their lives.\nWhen it comes to retirement age, there\u2019s a big gap in expectations versus reality. Americans generally retire earlier than planned \u2014 often due to factors beyond their control, such as poor health or job loss, research shows.\nSign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox\nGet this delivered to your inbox, and more info about our products and services. \nThose who target a retirement age past 61 end up making it about half as far as expected, he found. For example, someone who aims to retire at 69 would actually retire around age 65.\nIt may also be easier for many retirees today, especially those who can work from home, to find part-time gigs to help blunt the financial impact of earlier-than-expected retirement from full-time employment, experts said.\n\u201cJob loss at older ages is really consequential,\u201d said Johnson, a report co-author. He attributes much of that workplace dynamic to ageism.\nYet, countervailing trends are pushing workers to retire later.\n\u201cThe key is, these are things you aren\u2019t going to be able to control,\u201d Blanchett said.\nOne-third of workers expect to retire at age 70 or later \u2014 or not at all, according to EBRI. But only 6% of retirees said they did retire at 70.\nJohnson\u2019s research shows that in the aftermath of the Great Recession (from 2008 through 2012), workers 50 to 61 years old who lost a job were 20% less likely to be reemployed than workers in their 20s and early 30s. Those age 62 and older were 50% less likely to have a new job.\nMore than half, 56%, of full-time workers in their early 50s get pushed out of their jobs (due to circumstances like a layoff) before they\u2019re ready to retire, according to a 2018 paper published by the Urban Institute.\nToday\u2019s strong labor market means it may be easier for older workers to find a new job, Johnson said. However, it\u2019s unclear how long that strength will last.\nJust 10% who suffered an involuntary job separation in their early 50s ever earn as much per week after their separation as before it, the Urban Institute paper said. In other words, 90% earn less \u2014 \u201coften substantially less,\u201d Johnson said.\nSocial Security\u2019s full retirement age has gradually been pushed back, to as late as age 67 for anyone born in 1960 or after. Americans are living longer, meaning they need to amass more savings to fund their lifestyles in old age.\nData is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutes. Global Business and Financial News, Stock Quotes, and Market Data and Analysis.\nIn 2022, the average expected retirement age was 66, according to a Gallup poll. But the actual retirement age was 62, on average. While the averages have varied somewhat over the years, there has been a consistent gap of about five years between expected and actual retirement ages since 2002, Gallup said.\nLargely, this disproportionately affects people who plan to retire in their early 60s or later, according to Blanchett\u2019s research.\nAlmost half, 46%, of retirees said they left the workforce earlier than planned, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute\u2019s 2023 Retirement Confidence Survey. That share has been similar for the past two decades, largely hovering between 40% and 50%.\nMany may not be able to find a new job altogether.\n\u00a9 2023 CNBC LLC. All Rights Reserved. A Division of NBCUniversal\n\u201cWorking longer is in theory a good option to shore up your retirement savings,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBut when workers are preparing for retirement, they shouldn\u2019t bet to be able to stay in their jobs for as long as they want.\u201d\nOf course, a large share \u2014 35% \u2014 also said they could afford to retire early, EBRI found. And almost half of retirees said they were able to stop working at about the time they planned.\nIn 2023, 35% of people who said they retired earlier than planned did so because of a hardship like a health problem or disability, according to EBRI. Another 31% did so due to changes at their company.\nThe shift from pensions to 401(k)-type plans is also a factor, said Richard Johnson, senior fellow at the Urban Institute. Pensions generally offer an incentive to start collecting benefits at a certain age, whereas no such trigger exists in 401(k) plans, he said.\nDelaying retirement by just a few years can have a \u201cdramatic\u201d positive financial effect, Blanchett said.\nBut retiring earlier than anticipated can have the opposite impact, experts said.\nGot a confidential news tip?

In their brain it was like, \u2018This is an opportunity to turn $5,000 into $20,000.\u2019 And they potentially lost all of their money.\nMillings: When you\u2019re young, you want to be as aggressive as possible, and when you\u2019re older, you want to get more conservative. Risk mitigation is a huge part of that. We always tell people to start with indexes \u2014 an entire index or entire [industry] sector in an exchange-traded fund. That keeps you from having the volatility of watching a stock either appreciate \u2014 where you might get some upside \u2014 or depreciate, where the risk on the downside is far greater. \nData is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutes.

That\u2019s a common misconception also, that they go broke because they spend money lavishly. That\u2019s one part of it. But another major part is they\u2019re actually trying to do the right thing, they\u2019re just misinformed.\nYou mentioned financial freedom. How much money does someone need to be financially free?\nAnd what is financial freedom?\nCNBC interviewed the duo \u2014 who have been friends since childhood \u2014 to talk about personal finance and financial literacy in the U.S.\nRashad Bilal: Not understanding the importance of investing, or [not] knowing how compound interest works.\nPeople may have heard that investing and compound interest are important but might not know why. Can you speak to that?\n\u00a9 2023 CNBC LLC. All Rights Reserved. A Division of NBCUniversal\nRashad Bilal and Troy Millings are among a growing class of financial influencers who want to help people be smarter about money.\nHaving money doesn\u2019t alleviate the problems, it just makes the problems even worse. Understanding money or having a good understanding of money isn\u2019t something that\u2019s correlated with how much money you have.\nMillings: We\u2019re authentically ourselves, so there\u2019s a natural relatability because people see themselves in us. When people talk about finance they try to make it a language that is upspoken to the masses. Our mission was to democratize it, to make it seem like something that can be very relatable and digestible. We show up the way we are, we wear sweatshirts, we wear hoodies. We represent everybody. It doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s only for the elite or it\u2019s only for a select crowd.\nIt could differ. It could be in that eight-figure range. Or it could be seven figures. It\u2019s really about having the financial resources to do what you want and invest and create generational wealth. It needs to be something that lasts for generations.\nThe duo \u2014 a former financial advisor and a teacher, respectively \u2014 launched the podcast \u201cEarn Your Leisure\u201d nearly five years ago with a mission to promote literacy around money and entrepreneurship.\nFor your podcasts, you\u2019ve interviewed several famous and wealthy people \u2014 pro athletes, musicians and entertainers, for example. Are there certain things about finance that seem just as confusing for the rich and famous as for the average person?\nBilal: Most people probably aren\u2019t going to make $10 million \u2014 I\u2019m just being honest to the question you asked. We have to be honest.\nGot a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.\nIs that because wealthy people and celebrities have a capacity to overspend more than the average person?\nFor a long period of time, investing was something that people looked at more as a luxury, not a necessity, [thinking] if you\u2019re able to invest then you\u2019re in the top 1%, or you have to be wealthy to even consider that.\nI think the aspiration towards a certain goal, you might not be able to actually obtain that goal, but if you fall short you\u2019ll still probably be better [off] than you would have been if you had no aspiration and didn\u2019t follow any rules or didn\u2019t try to invest or start a business; you live off what you have. You won\u2019t buy a $1 million home if you only have $1,000 in your bank account. Your life will still be better financially than if you didn\u2019t follow the pathway towards the goal.\nMost people understand this without even fully realizing that they understand it because they have a retirement plan. The whole point of a retirement plan is investing. You put money into a 401(k), and that money gets invested with the expectation that when you\u2019re 65, 70 years old you\u2019ll have a nest egg you can draw from and live off of in retirement.\nBilal: I think everybody is different. I think it depends on where you live. But I would say, I think you have to be in the eight-figure-net-worth range if you live in suburban or metropolitan areas. I would say around that $10 million figure would provide some level of comfort if other aspects of your life are maintained.\nGreg Iacurci: You told CNBC last year that your \u201cpurpose is financial literacy and empowerment.\u201d When it comes to financial literacy, what\u2019s the No. 1 mistake you see people making with their finances?\nBilal: The only way to really achieve financial freedom is if your money is growing without you working for the money. How to achieve that is through investing. One dollar will only be $1 if it\u2019s saved in the bank. But $1 can become $2 if it\u2019s invested.\nData also provided by\nFinancial literacy is something I think gets metastasized on the highest level. Those are the same issues that everybody else has, it\u2019s just everybody else doesn\u2019t have the opportunity to lose $30 million or invest $20 million into a bad investment and then it goes belly up. If given the opportunity they probably would, it\u2019s just they don\u2019t have it. It\u2019s a bigger microscope on celebrities because they\u2019re public figures.\nIn a recent discussion with entrepreneur and musician Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, you mentioned that when he met you, he said you \u201cmake it cool to be educated.\u201d How do you go about that?"}, {"title": "Stocks making the biggest moves midday: Intel, Chipotle, Juniper Networks", "link": "", "date": "2023-10-27", "text": "\nAmazon\n\u2014 Shares of the e-commerce giant continued into the green on Friday, surging 6.8% after reporting strong third-quarter results and showing a 13% jump in revenue for the period.\nFord Motor\n\u2014 Shares of the automobile maker plunged nearly 12.3% Friday.

You can consult an insurer\u2019s in-network online directory or call your doctor or provider to ask if they accept your new insurance.\nEvery health plan has a summary of benefits and coverage, or SBC, which presents key cost-sharing information and plan details uniformly across all health insurance, Pollitz said.\nBudget is among the most important considerations, Winnie Sun, co-founder and managing director of Sun Group Wealth Partners in Irvine, California, previously told CNBC. She\u2019s also a member of CNBC\u2019s FA Council.\nThe deductible meshes with other forms of cost-sharing.\nFor example, would you struggle to pay a $1,000 medical bill if you require health care? If so, a health plan with a larger monthly premium and a smaller deductible may be your best bet, Sun said.\nHealth insurers treat services and costs differently based on their network.\nOut-of-pocket maximums for health plans purchased through an Affordable Care Act marketplace can\u2019t exceed $9,100 for individuals or $18,200 for a family in 2023.\nFor example, HMO plans are among the cheapest types of insurance, according to Aetna.

The paper, authored by economists at Carnegie Mellon University and the Wisconsin School of Business, examined choices made by almost 24,000 workers at a U.S. firm.\nThis is a limit on the total cost-sharing consumers pay during the year \u2014 including co-pays, co-insurance and deductibles.\nMore from Personal Finance:\n\u2018Cash stuffing\u2019 may forgo \u2018easiest money\u2019 you can make\nThese credit cards have had \u2018increasingly notable\u2019 high rates\nHome \u2018affordability is incredibly difficult,\u2019 economist says\n\u201cThe plans can be quite different\u201d from each other, she added.\n\u201cIn network\u201d refers to doctors and other health providers who are part of an insurer\u2019s preferred network. Insurers sign contracts and negotiate prices with these in-network providers. This isn\u2019t the case for \u201cout-of-network\u201d providers.\nThe average co-insurance rate for consumers is 19% for primary care and 20% for specialty care, according to KFF data. The insurer would pay the other 81% and 80% of the bill, respectively.\nFurther, there\u2019s sometimes no cap at all on annual costs for out-of-network care.\nThe average deductible can vary widely by plan type: $1,281 in a preferred provider organization (PPO) plan; $1,200 in a health maintenance organization (HMO) plan; $1,783 in a point of service (POS) plan; and $2,611 in a high-deductible health plan, according to KFF data on single coverage. (Details of plan types are outlined below.)\nData is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutes. Global Business and Financial News, Stock Quotes, and Market Data and Analysis.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re shopping for health insurance, people naturally shop like they do for most products \u2014 by the price,\u201d Karen Pollitz, co-director of KFF\u2019s program on patient and consumer protection, previously told CNBC.\nSimilarly, EPO plans also require in-network services for insurance coverage, but generally come with more choice than HMOs.\nBut choosing a health plan can be tricky.\nConsumers who enroll in a high-deductible plan should use their monthly savings on premiums to fund a health savings account, advisors said. HSAs are available to consumers who enroll in a high-deductible plan.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re shopping for tennis shoes or rice, you know what you\u2019re getting\u201d for the price, she said. \u201cBut people really should not just price shop, because health insurance is not a commodity.\u201d\nCo-pays and co-insurance may vary by service, with separate classifications for office visits, hospitalizations or prescription drugs, according to KFF. Rates and coverage may also differ for in-network and out-of-network providers.\n\u00a9 2023 CNBC LLC. All Rights Reserved. A Division of NBCUniversal\nThe same rationale goes for prescription drugs, Sun said: Would the cost of your current prescriptions change under a new health plan?\nMany people will soon be picking their health insurance plans for 2024: November is a common month for workplace open enrollment, and the public marketplace opens Nov. 1.\n\u201cYour financial liability for going out of network can be really quite dramatic,\u201d she added. \u201cIt can expose you to some serious medical bills.\u201d\nAs an example: If a specialty service costs $1,000, the average patient would pay 20% \u2014 or $200 \u2014 and the insurer would pay the remainder.\n\u201cIt is confusing, and people have no idea how much they could potentially have to pay,\u201d Carolyn McClanahan, a certified financial planner and founder of Life Planning Partners, based in Jacksonville, Florida, previously told CNBC. McClanahan is also a medical doctor and a member of CNBC\u2019s FA Council.\nAfter you\u2019ve paid the out-of-pocket maximum amount for the year, \u201cthe insurer can\u2019t ask you for a co-pay at the doctor or pharmacy, or hit you for more deductibles,\u201d Pollitz said. \u201cThat\u2019s it; you\u2019ve given your pound of flesh.\u201d\n\u201cHealth insurance really is all about the network,\u201d Pollitz said.\nAbout 99% of workers with single coverage are in a plan with an out-of-pocket maximum in 2023, according to KFF.\nSimilarly, older Americans or those who require a lot of health care each year \u2014 or who expect to have a costly procedure in the coming year \u2014 may do well to pick a plan with a bigger monthly premium but better cost-sharing.\nThe range can be large. For example, 13% of workers with single coverage have an out-of-pocket maximum of less than $2,000, but 21% have one of $6,000 or more, according to KFF data.\nPatients may owe additional cost-sharing, such as co-insurance, a percentage of health costs that the consumer shares with the insurer. This cost-sharing generally kicks in after you\u2019ve paid your annual deductible (a concept explained more fully below).\nFamily plans may also assess deductibles in two ways: by combining the aggregate annual out-of-pocket costs of all family members, and/or by subjecting each family member to a separate annual deductible before the plan covers costs for that member.\nLow premiums don\u2019t necessarily translate to good value. You may be on the hook for a big bill later if you see a doctor or pay for a procedure, depending on the plan.\nGot a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.\nHere\u2019s an example based on a $1,000 hospital charge. A patient with a $500 deductible pays the first $500 out of pocket. This patient also has 20% co-insurance, and therefore pays another $100 (or, 20% of the remaining $500 tab). This person would pay a total $600 out of pocket for this hospital visit.\nMany workers also owe a copayment \u2014 a flat dollar fee \u2014 when they visit a doctor. A \u201cco-pay\u201d is a form of cost-sharing with health insurers.\nThe average patient pays $26 for each visit to a primary-care doctor and $44 to visit a specialty care physician, according to KFF.\nDeductibles are another common form of cost-sharing.\nThis is the annual sum a consumer must pay out of pocket before the health insurer starts to pay for services.\nSome categories of plans disallow coverage for out-of-network services, with limited exception.\nHealth plans may have more than one deductible \u2014 perhaps one for general medical care and another for pharmacy benefits, for example, Pollitz said.\n\u201cI\u2019d urge people to spend a little time with the SBC,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t wait until an hour before the deadline to take a look. The stakes are high.\u201d\nData also provided by\nIt\u2019s perhaps the most transparent and easy-to-understand cost component of a health plan \u2014 the equivalent of a sticker price.\n\u201cCheaper plans have skinnier networks,\u201d McClanahan said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like the doctors, you may not get a good choice and have to go out of network.\u201d"}, {"title": "Stocks making the biggest moves midday: Spotify, Coca-Cola, DraftKings, 3M and more", "link": "", "date": "2023-10-24", "text": "\nBraze\n\u2014 The costumer engagement stock rose 3.4% on the heels of an upgrade to buy from neutral by D.A.

However, experts found that the very definition of retirement is also changing between generations.\nYounger workers also share the same sentiments, where two in three Gen Z are not sure if they will ever have enough money to retire. \nAs Americans spent significantly lower during the pandemic in the last two to three years, people more are likely to spend a lot more now to make up for lost time, she told CNBC.\nAs younger people enter the workforce, they bring in new financial priorities and are more likely to embrace a \u201cbalance between the traditional \u2018hustle\u2019 to save every single penny and using some of their extra income to enjoy life now,\u201d Viktorin said.\nHowever, this fear may not be that much of a concern for the younger generation, as most are actually not looking to retire early \u2014 and some don\u2019t want to retire at all, the report by Intuit showed.\nAlthough younger workers don\u2019t intend to stop working, there is still an effort to beef up their retirement savings.\nRetirement is the grand finale for most workers.

Underwood professor of law and associate dean at Vanderbilt University, told CNBC via email.\nThe action against Binance and its founder was a joint effort by the Department of Justice, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Treasury Department.\nThe exchange\u2019s native token, BNB, is down more than 8% in the last 24 hours. Binance holds around $2.8 billion worth of BNB tokens, according to Nansen. And in March, after Binance phased out zero-fee trading of crypto asset pairs including bitcoin, a key incentive for customers, the exchange began to see its share of all spot trading drop.\n\u201cThis, combined with the likely imminent approval of an ETF based on bitcoin quotes, could positively impact the crypto market in the long term,\u201d said Drozdz.\nBinance agreed to pay $4.3 billion in fines to the U.S. government.

In June, the agency hit Coinbase with a lawsuit similar to the one it brought against Binance, alleging it operates as an unauthorized securities exchange, broker and clearing agency. And on Monday the SEC sued Kraken, alleging that the exchange commingled $33 billion in customer crypto assets with its own company assets, creating the potential for a significant risk of loss to its users.\n\u201cThere is no doubt that Binance\u2019s reserves will be coming under scrutiny in the months and years to come,\u201d Yadav explained. \u201cA big question that has hung over Binance is how it is run, the state of its internal governance and risk management.\u201d\nAssets of more than $65 billion remain on the platform, according to Nansen, meaning that Binance is likely capitalized enough to withstand a sudden rush of investors away from the platform.

They looked around, saw that some people were doing better, some much better, and they got envious. And then they got mad.\nWhat does that mean in practice?  It\u2019s about managing your own expectations, and risk tolerance. \u201cIn personal finance, the right amount of savings is when it feels like it\u2019s a little too much.  It should feel excessive; it should make you wince a little.\u201d\n\u201cThe trick in any field\u2014from finance to careers to relationships\u2014is being able to survive the short-run problems so you can stick around long enough to enjoy the long-term growth\u2026An important lesson from history is that the long run is usually pretty good and the short run is usually pretty bad. It takes effort to reconcile those two and learn how to manage them with what seem like conflicting skills. Those who can\u2019t usually end up either bitter pessimists or bankrupt optimists.\u201d\nThis is an ambitious book that sits at the intersection between investing, self-help, leadership, and motivation & personal success.  The primary message is simple but easy to lose sight of:  technology, politics and other trends seem to be accelerating, but human behavior has not changed. \nData also provided by\nHousel\u2019s conclusion: \u201cWealth and happiness is a two-part equation: what you have and what you expect/need. When you realize that each part is equally important, you see that the overwhelming attention we pay to getting more and the negligible attention we put on managing expectations makes little sense, especially because the expectations side can be so much more in your control. \u201d\nBy the 1980s, that had changed. Changes in the tax code, among other changes, created a group of ultra-wealthy individuals: \u201cThe glorious lifestyles of the few inflated the aspirations of the many,\u201d Housel concluded.\nMore stats about the \u201cgolden era\u201d of the 1950s versus today:\nEnvy triumphs. Same as ever.\nNow Housel is back with a second book, \u201cSame As Ever: Timeless Lesson on Wealth, Greed and Happiness.\u201d\nIt utilizes the same style that Morgan rode to success in his previous book: short chapters, paragraphs, sentences and an emphasis on storytelling to reveal deep insights into very broad topics.\n\u201cWhen asked, \u2018You seem extremely happy and content. What\u2019s your secret to living a happy life?\u2019 Charlie Munger replied: The first rule of a happy life is low expectations. If you have unrealistic expectations you\u2019re going to be miserable your whole life. You want to have reasonable expectations and take life\u2019s results, good and bad, as they happen with a certain amount of stoicism.\u201d \nSo why are we so nostalgic about the 1950s? It gets down to envy and the very human desire to compare how you are doing with everyone else:  in the 1950s, \u201cThe gap between you and most of the people around you wasn\u2019t that large.\u201d \nBut Housel goes a bit deeper, which is what makes this book satisfying: Besides demonstrating that envy is a key element, what else does this nostalgia for the 1950s illustrate?\n(Note: Morgan Housel will be on HalfTime Report today at 12:35 PM ET and on ETF Edge at 1:10 PM.

Housel cites Charlie Munger, who noted that the world isn\u2019t driven by greed, it\u2019s driven by envy.\nHousel notes that envy has been given a much greater boost than in the past thanks to social media, \u201cin which everyone in the world can see the lifestyles \u2014 often inflated, faked, and airbrushed\u2014of other people. You compare yourself to your peers through a curated highlight reel of their lives, where positives are embellished and negatives are hidden from view.\u201d\n\u201cIf next year there\u2019s a 1 percent chance of a new disastrous pandemic, a 1 percent chance of a crippling depression, a 1 percent chance of a catastrophic flood, a 1 percent chance of political collapse, and on and on, then the odds that something bad will happen next year\u2014or any year\u2014are . . . not bad.\u201d\nGet this delivered to your inbox, and more info about our products and services. \nMorgan Housel has become the Mark Twain of financial writers: funny, pithy, folksy, occasionally sarcastic and always seeking to peel away the layers of reality to reveal a deeper truth below.\nDuring World War II, wages were set by the National War Labor Board, which preferred flatter wages: \u201cpart of that philosophy stuck around even after wage controls were lifted,\u201d Housel noted.\nMorgan illustrates this with a fine digression: Why are people so nostalgic about the past, and was it really better than the present?\nToday\u2019s families are also far wealthier than prior generations. Housel notes the median family income adjusted for inflation:\nI put this slightly differently: Everyone has circumstances that they are living in:  how much money they make, where they live, whom they are living with, what they own.  These circumstances have a definitely external reality.  Your mortgage is very real, as is your house or apartment, as is your spouse or partner.\nDuring the 1950s, very few people lived in financial circles that were dramatically better than everyone else. Smaller houses felt fine because everyone had one.  Everyone went on camping vacations because, well, that\u2019s what everyone did.\n \u201cThe ones who thrive long term are those who understand the real world is a never-ending chain of absurdity, confusion, messy relationships, and imperfect people.\u201d\nMorgan\u2019s thesis is that the same things that have motivated men and women throughout our existence (fear, love, hate, greed, envy) are still present today, and because of that, much of what happens is perfectly predictable: Same as ever.\nThe book not only caught on, it has sold roughly 4 million copies worldwide.\nHousel ends with a series of questions the reader should be asking themselves, including \u201cWhat strong belief do I hold that\u2019s most likely to change? What\u2019s always been true? What\u2019s the same as ever?\u201d\nAnd as long as those age-old emotions that motive us don\u2019t change, the new fancy gadgets we all have are just different tools to help us engage the same old emotions.\nTo give you an idea of how big that is, a typical financial book will sell roughly 5,000 copies. If you can sell 10,000 copies, you\u2019re really doing well.\nIt was a relatively brief (250 pages) book, with short chapters, laden with Housel\u2019s folksy wisdom on savings, the power of compounding interest, and plenty of stories about the role of luck and risk, and how certain key people (like Bill Gates) got lucky breaks that enabled them to go on to greater things (in Gates\u2019 case, he had attended Lakeside High School in Seattle, one of the few high schools that had a computer at the time).\n\u201cThe valuation of every company is simply a number from today multiplied by a story about tomorrow.\u201d\nData is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutes. Global Business and Financial News, Stock Quotes, and Market Data and Analysis.\nOn one level, it was: It was possible to have a family with one wage earner to have a modest, middle-class life.\nExcept this time Housel is going for a larger audience than those who wanted financial insights: He is going for timeless wisdom that is aiming to show people how to look at life in general. \n\u201cMedian hourly wages adjusted for inflation are nearly 50 percent higher today than in 1955,\u201d Housel noted. \u201cAnd higher income wasn\u2019t due to working more hours, or entirely due to women joining the workforce in greater numbers.\u201d  It was due to gains in productivity.\n\u201cMost great things in life\u2014from love to careers to investing\u2014gain their value from two things: patience and scarcity. Patience to let something grow, and scarcity to admire what it grows into.\u201d\nManaging risk is a topic Housel addressed in The Psychology of Money, and he returns to it again.   \n\u201cIf you understand the math behind compounding you realize the most important question is not \u2018How can I earn the highest returns?\u2019 It\u2019s \u2018What are the best returns I can sustain for the longest period of time?\u2019 Little changes compounded for a long time create extraordinary changes.\u201d\n\u201cThe best financial plan is to save like a pessimist and invest like an optimist. That idea\u2014the belief that things will get better mixed with the reality that the path between now and then will be a continuous chain of setback, disappointment, surprise, and shock\u2014shows up all over history, in all areas of life.\u201d\nBeyond your current circumstances, there are needs, and there are wants.  Needs are what people require to get by: shelter, food. Wants are what people aspire to:  a bigger house, a bigger car, a bigger everything. Those wants are being dramatically inflated by the wealth gap that has opened up and is amplified by social media. \nThis nostalgia, Housel says, \u201cis one of the best examples of what happens when expectations grow faster than circumstances.\u201d\nMortality rates were much higher. People died far younger.\nTake the 1950s, which baby boomers and their parents seem to think was some kind of golden age.\nHousel comes to the same conclusion:  \u201cthe expectation side of that equation is not only important, but it\u2019s often more in your control than managing your circumstances.\u201d\nGot a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.\n\u201cThe ability to say, I want that, why don\u2019t I have that? Why does he get it but I don\u2019t? is so much greater now than it was just a few generations ago. Today\u2019s economy is good at generating three things: wealth, the ability to show off wealth, and great envy for other people\u2019s wealth.\u201d\nHere\u2019s the mental trick: While your circumstances and your needs have a definite external reality, the \u201cwants\u201d only exist in your head; they have no external reality.  You don\u2019t have to be envious of your neighbor who has the Rolex or the big house.  To the extent that is causing your envy and your anxiety, it is completely in your own control to change those thoughts.  By changing your relationship with your wants, which only exist in your head, you can change the way you view your circumstances.\n\u201cWhat kind of person is likely to go overboard, bite off more than they can chew, and discount risks that are blindingly obvious to others? Someone who is determined, optimistic, doesn\u2019t take no for an answer, and is relentlessly confident in their own abilities\u2026the same personality traits that push people to the top also increase the odds of pushing them over the edge.\u201d\nBut the idea that people were better off in the 1950s is not supported by the facts. \nHousel is a partner at The Collaborative Fund and became a best-selling author with the 2020 publication of his book, The Psychology of Money. It explored the relationship between money and human behavior. The main thesis was to maximize what you can control: managing your own expectations, knowing when was enough, how to stop changing the goalposts.\n\u00a9 2023 CNBC LLC. All Rights Reserved.

In the U.S., the most recent jobs report showed the highest unemployment rate since January 2022, credit card delinquencies are at 12-year highs, and high yield defaults are comfortably off the lows,\u201d Deutsche\u2019s Head of Global Economics and Thematic Research, Jim Reid, and Group Chief Economist David Folkerts-Landau said in the report.\nGot a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.\nJPMAM Chief Market Strategist Karen Ward noted that many U.S. households took advantage of 30-year fixed rate mortgages while rates were still around 2.7%, while in the U.K., many shifted to five-year fixed rates during the Covid-19 pandemic, meaning the \u201cpassthrough of interest rates is much slower\u201d than previous cycles.\nThe U.S. economy\u2019s resilience has fueled an emerging consensus that the Federal Reserve will achieve its desired \u201csoft landing,\u201d slowing inflation without tipping the economy into recession.\n\u201cAt the outer edges of the economy there is obvious stress that is likely to spread in 2024 with rates at these levels. In the Euro Area, Q3 saw a -0.1% decline in GDP, with the economy in a period of stagnation since Autumn 2022 that will likely extend to mid-Summer 2024.\u201d\nHowever, she highlighted that U.K. exposure to higher rates is due to rise from about 38% at the end of 2023 to 60% at the end of 2024, while first-time buyers in the U.S. will be exposed to much higher rates and the cost of other consumer debt, such as auto loans, has also risen sharply.\n\u00a9 2023 CNBC LLC.

Companies often choose pretax \u2014 not Roth \u2014 accounts as the receptacle for automatic contributions. That means workers would have to make a proactive decision to switch their allocation.\nEmployers that match 401(k) savings have historically done so in the pretax savings bucket, regardless of whether the employee contributions are pretax or Roth.

Global Business and Financial News, Stock Quotes, and Market Data and Analysis.\nRoth 401(k) contributions may not be wise for all workers. Generally, they make sense for investors who are likely in a lower tax bracket now than they expect to be when they retire, according to financial advisors.\nA Roth is a type of after-tax account. Workers pay tax up front on 401(k) contributions, but investment growth and account withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This differs from traditional pretax savings, whereby workers get a tax break upfront but pay later.\nCatch-up contributions are available to people age 50 and older. Such workers are permitted to funnel an additional $7,500 into 401(k) plans in 2024, beyond the $23,000 annual limit.\nThe recently passed retirement law, known as Secure 2.0, is also expected to increase Roth uptake in another way. It will require \u201ccatch up\u201d 401(k) contributions to be made to Roth accounts, if the worker\u2019s income exceeds $145,000 (indexed to inflation).\nThat share has increased significantly over the past decade: Just 58.2% of employers made a Roth 401(k) available in 2013, PSCA found. It also rose slightly over the past year, from 87.8% in 2021.\nFor example, investors with Roth 401(k) savings won\u2019t need to take required minimum distributions from those accounts starting in 2024. This already applies to Roth IRAs. However, the same isn\u2019t true for traditional pretax accounts: Retirees must pull funds from pretax 401(k)s and IRAs starting at age 73, even if they don\u2019t need the money.\nThere are a few reasons why usage likely doesn\u2019t correspond with overall availability.\nGot a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.\nRoth savings can also help reduce annual premiums for Medicare Part B, which are based on taxable income. Because Roth withdrawals are considered tax-free income, pulling money strategically from Roth accounts can prevent one\u2019s income from jumping over certain Medicare thresholds.\nHowever, there are some guiding principles for Roth.\n\u00a9 2023 CNBC LLC. All Rights Reserved. A Division of NBCUniversal\nSome may shun Roth savings because they assume both their spending and their tax bracket will fall when they retire. But that doesn\u2019t always happen, according to financial advisors.\nThat\u2019s because they would accumulate a larger nest egg by paying tax now at a lower tax rate.\nFor example, Roth accounts generally make sense for young people, especially those just entering the workforce, who are likely to have their highest-earning years ahead of them. Those contributions and any investment growth would then compound tax-free for decades. (One important note: Investment growth is only tax-free for withdrawals after age 59\u00bd, and provided you have had the Roth account for at least five years.)\nHowever, Roth uptake by employees remains relatively low by comparison: About 21% of workers made a Roth contribution in 2022, according to PSCA data. By comparison, 72% saved in a traditional pretax account. (Workers can opt to use either, or both.)\nEmployers must make the change by 2026.

And your current employer may not accept rollovers into your 401(k) from a previous employer\u2019s plan.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll want to look at whether your 401(k) is a good plan with diverse, low-cost investment choices and fees,\u201d said Carolyn McClanahan, a certified financial planner and founder of Life Planning Partners in Jacksonville, Florida. She is also a member of CNBC\u2019s FA Council. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t a good plan, we encourage rolling it into a new 401(k) or IRA.\u201d\nA rollover may be \u201cthe single largest transaction\u201d many people make in their life, Fred Reish, a retirement expert and partner at law firm Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath, recently told CNBC.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a quick fix,\u201d she said.  \nHere are some key details to weigh when choosing to keep money in your 401(k) or move it to an IRA.\nThe tax move is known as \u201cnet unrealized appreciation.\u201d Basically, by keeping stock in your 401(k), you\u2019d ultimately pay preferential, capital gains tax rates on any investment growth (rather than ordinary income tax rates) withdrawn in retirement. This tactic isn\u2019t an option if you roll the money into an IRA.\nData also provided by\nIRA assets may not be protected, depending on the strength of state laws.\nCertain retirement investments like annuities, physical real estate or private company stock are generally unavailable to 401(k) savers, said Ted Jenkin, a certified financial planner based in Atlanta and founder of oXYGen Financial.\nInvestors generally get stronger creditor protections in a 401(k) than an IRA, courtesy of federal law, advisors said.\nAnother consideration: While the investment options may be fewer in a 401(k), employers have a legal obligation \u2014 known as a \u201cfiduciary\u201d duty \u2014 to curate and continually monitor a list of funds that\u2019s best suited to their workers.\nData is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutes.

You can\u2019t borrow money or take a loan from an IRA.\nFor example, just 61% of 401(k) plans allowed periodic or partial withdrawals by retirees in 2022, and 55% allowed installment payments, according to the Plan Sponsor Council of America, a trade group.\nGot a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.\nThat\u2019s largely because IRA investors are \u201cretail\u201d investors while 401(k) savers often get access to more favorable \u201cinstitutional\u201d pricing. Employers pool workers into one retirement plan and have more buying power; those economies of scale generally yield cheaper annual investment fees.\nBut deciding whether a rollover makes sense isn\u2019t always straightforward: There are many factors to consider before moving the money. The Department of Labor recently proposed a regulation to improve the rollover advice investors get from brokers, insurance agents and others.\nIf this is the case, Lander advises workers to ask their employer\u2019s human resources department about the policy and whether it can be amended.\nThe bottom line: Compare annual 401(k) fees \u2014 like investment \u201cexpense ratios\u201d and administrative costs \u2014 to those of an IRA.\nRollovers to an IRA made in 2018 will cost investors an aggregate $45.5 billion over a 25-year period due to higher fund fees, according to an estimate by c.\nBut 401(k) options are limited to those selected by your employer. With an IRA, the menu is often much broader.\nYour 401(k) money would generally be protected from seizure in the event of bankruptcy or if you faced a civil suit from someone who, for example, fell and got injured in your home, Lander said.\nDon\u2019t miss these stories from CNBC PRO:\nSuch \u201crollovers\u201d are common when workers retire or take new jobs at different employers.

Noting that core inflation has run at a 2.5% annual rate over the past six months, Powell said, \u201cwhile the lower inflation readings of the past few months are welcome, that progress must continue if we are to reach our 2 percent objective.\u201d\n\u201cThe strong actions we have taken have moved our policy rate well into restrictive territory, meaning that tight monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation,\u201d Powell said. \u201cMonetary policy is thought to affect economic conditions with a lag, and the full effects of our tightening have likely not yet been felt.\u201d\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday pushed back on market expectations for aggressive interest rate cuts ahead, calling it too early to declare victory over inflation.\n\u201cHaving come so far so quickly, the FOMC is moving forward carefully, as the risks of under- and over-tightening are becoming more balanced,\u201d he said.\n\u201cInflation is still running well above target, but it\u2019s moving in the right direction,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we think the right thing to be doing now is to be moving carefully, thinking carefully about about how things are going on letting letting the data tell us what the story is. The data will tell us whether we\u2019ve done enough or whether we need to do more.\u201d\nMarket pricing Friday morning indicated that the Fed indeed is done hiking and could start cutting as soon as March 2024, according to the CME Group. Moreover, futures are pointing to cuts totaling 1.25 percentage points by the end of the year, the equivalent of five quarter percentage point reductions.\nExpectations that the Fed is done raising rates and will move to an easing posture in 2024 have helped underpin a strong Wall Street rally that has sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average up more than 8% over the past month to a new 2023 high.\nData also provided by\nPowell\u2019s remarks gave some credence to the idea that the Fed at least is done hiking as the string of rate hikes since March 2022 have cut into economic activity.\nA Commerce Department report Thursday showed that personal consumption expenditures prices, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, were up 3% from a year ago, but 3.5% at a core basis that excludes volatile food and energy prices. Recent sharp declines in energy have been responsible for much of the easing in inflation.\nAddressing the economic data, Powell characterized the labor market as \u201cvery strong,\u201d through he said a reduced pace of job creation is helping bring supply and demand back in line.\nData is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutes.

But like his friend and colleague, Munger was a font of wisdom in investing, and in life. And like one of his heroes, Benjamin Franklin, Munger\u2019s insight didn\u2019t lack humor.\nMunger donated hundreds of millions of dollars to educational institutions, including the University of Michigan, Stanford University and Harvard Law School, often with the stipulation that the school accept his building designs, even though he was not formally trained as an architect.\nTwo years later, he married Nancy Barry, whom he met on a blind date at a chicken dinner restaurant. The couple had four children, Charles Jr., Emilie, Barry and Philip. He also was the stepfather to her two other sons, William Harold Borthwick and David Borthwick. The Mungers, who were married 54 years until her death in 2010, contributed $43.5 million to Stanford University to help build the Munger Graduate Residence, which houses 600 law and graduate students.\n\u201cAny time you go to a football game or a function there\u2019s a huge line outside the women\u2019s bathroom.

It has since produced more than $2 billion in sales for Berkshire.\n\u201cHe weaned me away from the idea of buying very so-so companies at very cheap prices, knowing that there was some small profit in it, and looking for some really wonderful businesses that we could buy in fair prices,\u201d Buffett told CNBC in May 2016.\nData also provided by\nBillionaire Charlie Munger, the investing sage who made a fortune even before he became Warren Buffett\u2019s right-hand man at Berkshire Hathaway, has died at age 99.\nMunger was chairman and CEO of Wesco Financial from 1984 to 2011, when Buffett\u2019s Berkshire purchased the remaining shares of the Pasadena, California-based insurance and investment company it did not own.\n\u201cAnd staying cheerful ... because it\u2019s a wise thing to do.

(Booth, who died in 2008, had been introduced to Buffett by Munger in 1963 and became one of Berkshire\u2019s largest investors.)\nIn 1959, at age 35, Munger returned to Omaha to close his late father\u2019s legal practice.

Three years later, he became vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway.\nDuring Berkshire\u2019s 2021 annual shareholder meeting, the then-97-year-old Munger apparently inadvertently revealed a well-guarded secret: that Vice Chairman Greg Abel \u201cwill keep the culture\u201d after the Buffett era.\n\u201cWe never had an argument in the entire time we\u2019ve known each other, which is almost 60 years now,\u201d Buffett told CNBC\u2019s Becky Quick in 2018. \u201cCharlie has given me the ultimate gift that a person can give to somebody else.

In California, he fell in love with his sister\u2019s roommate at Scripps College, Nancy Huggins, and married her in 1945. Although he never completed his undergraduate degree, Munger graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law School in 1948, and the couple moved back to California, where he practiced real estate law. He founded the law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson in 1962 and focused on managing investments at the hedge fund Wheeler, Munger & Co., which he also founded that year.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have a lot of envy, you don\u2019t have a lot of resentment, you don\u2019t overspend your income, you stay cheerful in spite of your troubles. You deal with reliable people and you do what you\u2019re supposed to do. And all these simple rules work so well to make your life better. And they\u2019re so trite,\u201d he said.\nThe melding of the minds focused on value investing, in which stocks are picked because their price appears to be undervalued based on the company\u2019s long-term fundamentals.\nAt Los Angeles\u2019 Harvard-Westlake prep school, where Munger had been a board member for decades, he ensured that the girls bathrooms were larger than the boys room during the construction of the science center in the 1990s.\nAt 17, Munger left Omaha for the University of Michigan.
