Individuals also funneled $79 billion into indexed annuities in 2022, an annual record, according to LIMRA, an insurance industry group.

Its proposal would subject financial advisors and others who work with retirement investors to a \u201cfiduciary\u201d legal standard under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, according to administration officials.\nThe Labor Department also tried to rewrite so-called fiduciary rules during the Obama administration.

The problem is, you can\u2019t count on it as a strategy.\nSuch people continue to get a regular paycheck, so don\u2019t have to live off their savings. Meanwhile, they have extra time to save and for their assets to (hopefully) grow. Further, they can likely delay claiming Social Security benefits, guaranteeing a higher monthly payout for the rest of their lives.\nWhen it comes to retirement age, there\u2019s a big gap in expectations versus reality. Americans generally retire earlier than planned \u2014 often due to factors beyond their control, such as poor health or job loss, research shows.\nSign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox\nGet this delivered to your inbox, and more info about our products and services. \nThose who target a retirement age past 61 end up making it about half as far as expected, he found. For example, someone who aims to retire at 69 would actually retire around age 65.\nIt may also be easier for many retirees today, especially those who can work from home, to find part-time gigs to help blunt the financial impact of earlier-than-expected retirement from full-time employment, experts said.\n\u201cJob loss at older ages is really consequential,\u201d said Johnson, a report co-author. He attributes much of that workplace dynamic to ageism.\nYet, countervailing trends are pushing workers to retire later.\n\u201cThe key is, these are things you aren\u2019t going to be able to control,\u201d Blanchett said.\nOne-third of workers expect to retire at age 70 or later \u2014 or not at all, according to EBRI. But only 6% of retirees said they did retire at 70.\nJohnson\u2019s research shows that in the aftermath of the Great Recession (from 2008 through 2012), workers 50 to 61 years old who lost a job were 20% less likely to be reemployed than workers in their 20s and early 30s. Those age 62 and older were 50% less likely to have a new job.\nMore than half, 56%, of full-time workers in their early 50s get pushed out of their jobs (due to circumstances like a layoff) before they\u2019re ready to retire, according to a 2018 paper published by the Urban Institute.\nToday\u2019s strong labor market means it may be easier for older workers to find a new job, Johnson said. However, it\u2019s unclear how long that strength will last.\nJust 10% who suffered an involuntary job separation in their early 50s ever earn as much per week after their separation as before it, the Urban Institute paper said. In other words, 90% earn less \u2014 \u201coften substantially less,\u201d Johnson said.\nSocial Security\u2019s full retirement age has gradually been pushed back, to as late as age 67 for anyone born in 1960 or after. Americans are living longer, meaning they need to amass more savings to fund their lifestyles in old age.\nData is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutes. Global Business and Financial News, Stock Quotes, and Market Data and Analysis.\nIn 2022, the average expected retirement age was 66, according to a Gallup poll. But the actual retirement age was 62, on average. While the averages have varied somewhat over the years, there has been a consistent gap of about five years between expected and actual retirement ages since 2002, Gallup said.\nLargely, this disproportionately affects people who plan to retire in their early 60s or later, according to Blanchett\u2019s research.\nAlmost half, 46%, of retirees said they left the workforce earlier than planned, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute\u2019s 2023 Retirement Confidence Survey. That share has been similar for the past two decades, largely hovering between 40% and 50%.\nMany may not be able to find a new job altogether.\n\u00a9 2023 CNBC LLC. All Rights Reserved. A Division of NBCUniversal\n\u201cWorking longer is in theory a good option to shore up your retirement savings,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBut when workers are preparing for retirement, they shouldn\u2019t bet to be able to stay in their jobs for as long as they want.\u201d\nOf course, a large share \u2014 35% \u2014 also said they could afford to retire early, EBRI found. And almost half of retirees said they were able to stop working at about the time they planned.\nIn 2023, 35% of people who said they retired earlier than planned did so because of a hardship like a health problem or disability, according to EBRI. Another 31% did so due to changes at their company.\nThe shift from pensions to 401(k)-type plans is also a factor, said Richard Johnson, senior fellow at the Urban Institute. Pensions generally offer an incentive to start collecting benefits at a certain age, whereas no such trigger exists in 401(k) plans, he said.\nDelaying retirement by just a few years can have a \u201cdramatic\u201d positive financial effect, Blanchett said.\nBut retiring earlier than anticipated can have the opposite impact, experts said.\nGot a confidential news tip?

In their brain it was like, \u2018This is an opportunity to turn $5,000 into $20,000.\u2019 And they potentially lost all of their money.\nMillings: When you\u2019re young, you want to be as aggressive as possible, and when you\u2019re older, you want to get more conservative. Risk mitigation is a huge part of that. We always tell people to start with indexes \u2014 an entire index or entire [industry] sector in an exchange-traded fund. That keeps you from having the volatility of watching a stock either appreciate \u2014 where you might get some upside \u2014 or depreciate, where the risk on the downside is far greater. \nData is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutes.

That\u2019s a common misconception also, that they go broke because they spend money lavishly. That\u2019s one part of it. But another major part is they\u2019re actually trying to do the right thing, they\u2019re just misinformed.\nYou mentioned financial freedom. How much money does someone need to be financially free?\nAnd what is financial freedom?\nCNBC interviewed the duo \u2014 who have been friends since childhood \u2014 to talk about personal finance and financial literacy in the U.S.\nRashad Bilal: Not understanding the importance of investing, or [not] knowing how compound interest works.\nPeople may have heard that investing and compound interest are important but might not know why. Can you speak to that?\n\u00a9 2023 CNBC LLC. All Rights Reserved. A Division of NBCUniversal\nRashad Bilal and Troy Millings are among a growing class of financial influencers who want to help people be smarter about money.\nHaving money doesn\u2019t alleviate the problems, it just makes the problems even worse. Understanding money or having a good understanding of money isn\u2019t something that\u2019s correlated with how much money you have.\nMillings: We\u2019re authentically ourselves, so there\u2019s a natural relatability because people see themselves in us. When people talk about finance they try to make it a language that is upspoken to the masses. Our mission was to democratize it, to make it seem like something that can be very relatable and digestible. We show up the way we are, we wear sweatshirts, we wear hoodies. We represent everybody. It doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s only for the elite or it\u2019s only for a select crowd.\nIt could differ. It could be in that eight-figure range. Or it could be seven figures. It\u2019s really about having the financial resources to do what you want and invest and create generational wealth. It needs to be something that lasts for generations.\nThe duo \u2014 a former financial advisor and a teacher, respectively \u2014 launched the podcast \u201cEarn Your Leisure\u201d nearly five years ago with a mission to promote literacy around money and entrepreneurship.\nFor your podcasts, you\u2019ve interviewed several famous and wealthy people \u2014 pro athletes, musicians and entertainers, for example. Are there certain things about finance that seem just as confusing for the rich and famous as for the average person?\nBilal: Most people probably aren\u2019t going to make $10 million \u2014 I\u2019m just being honest to the question you asked. We have to be honest.\nGot a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.\nIs that because wealthy people and celebrities have a capacity to overspend more than the average person?\nFor a long period of time, investing was something that people looked at more as a luxury, not a necessity, [thinking] if you\u2019re able to invest then you\u2019re in the top 1%, or you have to be wealthy to even consider that.\nI think the aspiration towards a certain goal, you might not be able to actually obtain that goal, but if you fall short you\u2019ll still probably be better [off] than you would have been if you had no aspiration and didn\u2019t follow any rules or didn\u2019t try to invest or start a business; you live off what you have. You won\u2019t buy a $1 million home if you only have $1,000 in your bank account. Your life will still be better financially than if you didn\u2019t follow the pathway towards the goal.\nMost people understand this without even fully realizing that they understand it because they have a retirement plan. The whole point of a retirement plan is investing. You put money into a 401(k), and that money gets invested with the expectation that when you\u2019re 65, 70 years old you\u2019ll have a nest egg you can draw from and live off of in retirement.\nBilal: I think everybody is different. I think it depends on where you live. But I would say, I think you have to be in the eight-figure-net-worth range if you live in suburban or metropolitan areas. I would say around that $10 million figure would provide some level of comfort if other aspects of your life are maintained.\nGreg Iacurci: You told CNBC last year that your \u201cpurpose is financial literacy and empowerment.\u201d When it comes to financial literacy, what\u2019s the No. 1 mistake you see people making with their finances?\nBilal: The only way to really achieve financial freedom is if your money is growing without you working for the money. How to achieve that is through investing. One dollar will only be $1 if it\u2019s saved in the bank. But $1 can become $2 if it\u2019s invested.\nData also provided by\nFinancial literacy is something I think gets metastasized on the highest level. Those are the same issues that everybody else has, it\u2019s just everybody else doesn\u2019t have the opportunity to lose $30 million or invest $20 million into a bad investment and then it goes belly up. If given the opportunity they probably would, it\u2019s just they don\u2019t have it. It\u2019s a bigger microscope on celebrities because they\u2019re public figures.\nIn a recent discussion with entrepreneur and musician Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, you mentioned that when he met you, he said you \u201cmake it cool to be educated.\u201d How do you go about that?"}, {"title": "Stocks making the biggest moves midday: Intel, Chipotle, Juniper Networks", "link": "", "date": "2023-10-27", "text": "\nAmazon\n\u2014 Shares of the e-commerce giant continued into the green on Friday, surging 6.8% after reporting strong third-quarter results and showing a 13% jump in revenue for the period.\nFord Motor\n\u2014 Shares of the automobile maker plunged nearly 12.3% Friday.

You can consult an insurer\u2019s in-network online directory or call your doctor or provider to ask if they accept your new insurance.\nEvery health plan has a summary of benefits and coverage, or SBC, which presents key cost-sharing information and plan details uniformly across all health insurance, Pollitz said.\nBudget is among the most important considerations, Winnie Sun, co-founder and managing director of Sun Group Wealth Partners in Irvine, California, previously told CNBC. She\u2019s also a member of CNBC\u2019s FA Council.\nThe deductible meshes with other forms of cost-sharing.\nFor example, would you struggle to pay a $1,000 medical bill if you require health care? If so, a health plan with a larger monthly premium and a smaller deductible may be your best bet, Sun said.\nHealth insurers treat services and costs differently based on their network.\nOut-of-pocket maximums for health plans purchased through an Affordable Care Act marketplace can\u2019t exceed $9,100 for individuals or $18,200 for a family in 2023.\nFor example, HMO plans are among the cheapest types of insurance, according to Aetna.

The paper, authored by economists at Carnegie Mellon University and the Wisconsin School of Business, examined choices made by almost 24,000 workers at a U.S. firm.\nThis is a limit on the total cost-sharing consumers pay during the year \u2014 including co-pays, co-insurance and deductibles.\nMore from Personal Finance:\n\u2018Cash stuffing\u2019 may forgo \u2018easiest money\u2019 you can make\nThese credit cards have had \u2018increasingly notable\u2019 high rates\nHome \u2018affordability is incredibly difficult,\u2019 economist says\n\u201cThe plans can be quite different\u201d from each other, she added.\n\u201cIn network\u201d refers to doctors and other health providers who are part of an insurer\u2019s preferred network. Insurers sign contracts and negotiate prices with these in-network providers. This isn\u2019t the case for \u201cout-of-network\u201d providers.\nThe average co-insurance rate for consumers is 19% for primary care and 20% for specialty care, according to KFF data. The insurer would pay the other 81% and 80% of the bill, respectively.\nFurther, there\u2019s sometimes no cap at all on annual costs for out-of-network care.\nThe average deductible can vary widely by plan type: $1,281 in a preferred provider organization (PPO) plan; $1,200 in a health maintenance organization (HMO) plan; $1,783 in a point of service (POS) plan; and $2,611 in a high-deductible health plan, according to KFF data on single coverage. (Details of plan types are outlined below.)\nData is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutes. Global Business and Financial News, Stock Quotes, and Market Data and Analysis.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re shopping for health insurance, people naturally shop like they do for most products \u2014 by the price,\u201d Karen Pollitz, co-director of KFF\u2019s program on patient and consumer protection, previously told CNBC.\nSimilarly, EPO plans also require in-network services for insurance coverage, but generally come with more choice than HMOs.\nBut choosing a health plan can be tricky.\nConsumers who enroll in a high-deductible plan should use their monthly savings on premiums to fund a health savings account, advisors said. HSAs are available to consumers who enroll in a high-deductible plan.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re shopping for tennis shoes or rice, you know what you\u2019re getting\u201d for the price, she said. \u201cBut people really should not just price shop, because health insurance is not a commodity.\u201d\nCo-pays and co-insurance may vary by service, with separate classifications for office visits, hospitalizations or prescription drugs, according to KFF. Rates and coverage may also differ for in-network and out-of-network providers.\n\u00a9 2023 CNBC LLC. All Rights Reserved. A Division of NBCUniversal\nThe same rationale goes for prescription drugs, Sun said: Would the cost of your current prescriptions change under a new health plan?\nMany people will soon be picking their health insurance plans for 2024: November is a common month for workplace open enrollment, and the public marketplace opens Nov. 1.\n\u201cYour financial liability for going out of network can be really quite dramatic,\u201d she added. \u201cIt can expose you to some serious medical bills.\u201d\nAs an example: If a specialty service costs $1,000, the average patient would pay 20% \u2014 or $200 \u2014 and the insurer would pay the remainder.\n\u201cIt is confusing, and people have no idea how much they could potentially have to pay,\u201d Carolyn McClanahan, a certified financial planner and founder of Life Planning Partners, based in Jacksonville, Florida, previously told CNBC. McClanahan is also a medical doctor and a member of CNBC\u2019s FA Council.\nAfter you\u2019ve paid the out-of-pocket maximum amount for the year, \u201cthe insurer can\u2019t ask you for a co-pay at the doctor or pharmacy, or hit you for more deductibles,\u201d Pollitz said. \u201cThat\u2019s it; you\u2019ve given your pound of flesh.\u201d\n\u201cHealth insurance really is all about the network,\u201d Pollitz said.\nAbout 99% of workers with single coverage are in a plan with an out-of-pocket maximum in 2023, according to KFF.\nSimilarly, older Americans or those who require a lot of health care each year \u2014 or who expect to have a costly procedure in the coming year \u2014 may do well to pick a plan with a bigger monthly premium but better cost-sharing.\nThe range can be large. For example, 13% of workers with single coverage have an out-of-pocket maximum of less than $2,000, but 21% have one of $6,000 or more, according to KFF data.\nPatients may owe additional cost-sharing, such as co-insurance, a percentage of health costs that the consumer shares with the insurer. This cost-sharing generally kicks in after you\u2019ve paid your annual deductible (a concept explained more fully below).\nFamily plans may also assess deductibles in two ways: by combining the aggregate annual out-of-pocket costs of all family members, and/or by subjecting each family member to a separate annual deductible before the plan covers costs for that member.\nLow premiums don\u2019t necessarily translate to good value. You may be on the hook for a big bill later if you see a doctor or pay for a procedure, depending on the plan.\nGot a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.\nHere\u2019s an example based on a $1,000 hospital charge. A patient with a $500 deductible pays the first $500 out of pocket. This patient also has 20% co-insurance, and therefore pays another $100 (or, 20% of the remaining $500 tab). This person would pay a total $600 out of pocket for this hospital visit.\nMany workers also owe a copayment \u2014 a flat dollar fee \u2014 when they visit a doctor. A \u201cco-pay\u201d is a form of cost-sharing with health insurers.\nThe average patient pays $26 for each visit to a primary-care doctor and $44 to visit a specialty care physician, according to KFF.\nDeductibles are another common form of cost-sharing.\nThis is the annual sum a consumer must pay out of pocket before the health insurer starts to pay for services.\nSome categories of plans disallow coverage for out-of-network services, with limited exception.\nHealth plans may have more than one deductible \u2014 perhaps one for general medical care and another for pharmacy benefits, for example, Pollitz said.\n\u201cI\u2019d urge people to spend a little time with the SBC,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t wait until an hour before the deadline to take a look. The stakes are high.\u201d\nData also provided by\nIt\u2019s perhaps the most transparent and easy-to-understand cost component of a health plan \u2014 the equivalent of a sticker price.\n\u201cCheaper plans have skinnier networks,\u201d McClanahan said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like the doctors, you may not get a good choice and have to go out of network.\u201d"}, {"title": "Stocks making the biggest moves midday: Spotify, Coca-Cola, DraftKings, 3M and more", "link": "", "date": "2023-10-24", "text": "\nBraze\n\u2014 The costumer engagement stock rose 3.4% on the heels of an upgrade to buy from neutral by D.A.

However, experts found that the very definition of retirement is also changing between generations.\nYounger workers also share the same sentiments, where two in three Gen Z are not sure if they will ever have enough money to retire. \nAs Americans spent significantly lower during the pandemic in the last two to three years, people more are likely to spend a lot more now to make up for lost time, she told CNBC.\nAs younger people enter the workforce, they bring in new financial priorities and are more likely to embrace a \u201cbalance between the traditional \u2018hustle\u2019 to save every single penny and using some of their extra income to enjoy life now,\u201d Viktorin said.\nHowever, this fear may not be that much of a concern for the younger generation, as most are actually not looking to retire early \u2014 and some don\u2019t want to retire at all, the report by Intuit showed.\nAlthough younger workers don\u2019t intend to stop working, there is still an effort to beef up their retirement savings.\nRetirement is the grand finale for most workers.

Underwood professor of law and associate dean at Vanderbilt University, told CNBC via email.\nThe action against Binance and its founder was a joint effort by the Department of Justice, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Treasury Department.\nThe exchange\u2019s native token, BNB, is down more than 8% in the last 24 hours. Binance holds around $2.8 billion worth of BNB tokens, according to Nansen. And in March, after Binance phased out zero-fee trading of crypto asset pairs including bitcoin, a key incentive for customers, the exchange began to see its share of all spot trading drop.\n\u201cThis, combined with the likely imminent approval of an ETF based on bitcoin quotes, could positively impact the crypto market in the long term,\u201d said Drozdz.\nBinance agreed to pay $4.3 billion in fines to the U.S. government.

In June, the agency hit Coinbase with a lawsuit similar to the one it brought against Binance, alleging it operates as an unauthorized securities exchange, broker and clearing agency. And on Monday the SEC sued Kraken, alleging that the exchange commingled $33 billion in customer crypto assets with its own company assets, creating the potential for a significant risk of loss to its users.\n\u201cThere is no doubt that Binance\u2019s reserves will be coming under scrutiny in the months and years to come,\u201d Yadav explained. \u201cA big question that has hung over Binance is how it is run, the state of its internal governance and risk management.\u201d\nAssets of more than $65 billion remain on the platform, according to Nansen, meaning that Binance is likely capitalized enough to withstand a sudden rush of investors away from the platform.

They looked around, saw that some people were doing better, some much better, and they got envious. And then they got mad.\nWhat does that mean in practice?  It\u2019s about managing your own expectations, and risk tolerance. \u201cIn personal finance, the right amount of savings is when it feels like it\u2019s a little too much.  It should feel excessive; it should make you wince a little.\u201d\n\u201cThe trick in any field\u2014from finance to careers to relationships\u2014is being able to survive the short-run problems so you can stick around long enough to enjoy the long-term growth\u2026An important lesson from history is that the long run is usually pretty good and the short run is usually pretty bad. It takes effort to reconcile those two and learn how to manage them with what seem like conflicting skills. Those who can\u2019t usually end up either bitter pessimists or bankrupt optimists.\u201d\nThis is an ambitious book that sits at the intersection between investing, self-help, leadership, and motivation & personal success.  The primary message is simple but easy to lose sight of:  technology, politics and other trends seem to be accelerating, but human behavior has not changed. \nData also provided by\nHousel\u2019s conclusion: \u201cWealth and happiness is a two-part equation: what you have and what you expect/need. When you realize that each part is equally important, you see that the overwhelming attention we pay to getting more and the negligible attention we put on managing expectations makes little sense, especially because the expectations side can be so much more in your control. \u201d\nBy the 1980s, that had changed. Changes in the tax code, among other changes, created a group of ultra-wealthy individuals: \u201cThe glorious lifestyles of the few inflated the aspirations of the many,\u201d Housel concluded.\nMore stats about the \u201cgolden era\u201d of the 1950s versus today:\nEnvy triumphs. Same as ever.\nNow Housel is back with a second book, \u201cSame As Ever: Timeless Lesson on Wealth, Greed and Happiness.\u201d\nIt utilizes the same style that Morgan rode to success in his previous book: short chapters, paragraphs, sentences and an emphasis on storytelling to reveal deep insights into very broad topics.\n\u201cWhen asked, \u2018You seem extremely happy and content. What\u2019s your secret to living a happy life?\u2019 Charlie Munger replied: The first rule of a happy life is low expectations. If you have unrealistic expectations you\u2019re going to be miserable your whole life. You want to have reasonable expectations and take life\u2019s results, good and bad, as they happen with a certain amount of stoicism.\u201d \nSo why are we so nostalgic about the 1950s? It gets down to envy and the very human desire to compare how you are doing with everyone else:  in the 1950s, \u201cThe gap between you and most of the people around you wasn\u2019t that large.\u201d \nBut Housel goes a bit deeper, which is what makes this book satisfying: Besides demonstrating that envy is a key element, what else does this nostalgia for the 1950s illustrate?\n(Note: Morgan Housel will be on HalfTime Report today at 12:35 PM ET and on ETF Edge at 1:10 PM.

Housel cites Charlie Munger, who noted that the world isn\u2019t driven by greed, it\u2019s driven by envy.\nHousel notes that envy has been given a much greater boost than in the past thanks to social media, \u201cin which everyone in the world can see the lifestyles \u2014 often inflated, faked, and airbrushed\u2014of other people. You compare yourself to your peers through a curated highlight reel of their lives, where positives are embellished and negatives are hidden from view.\u201d\n\u201cIf next year there\u2019s a 1 percent chance of a new disastrous pandemic, a 1 percent chance of a crippling depression, a 1 percent chance of a catastrophic flood, a 1 percent chance of political collapse, and on and on, then the odds that something bad will happen next year\u2014or any year\u2014are . . . not bad.\u201d\nGet this delivered to your inbox, and more info about our products and services. \nMorgan Housel has become the Mark Twain of financial writers: funny, pithy, folksy, occasionally sarcastic and always seeking to peel away the layers of reality to reveal a deeper truth below.\nDuring World War II, wages were set by the National War Labor Board, which preferred flatter wages: \u201cpart of that philosophy stuck around even after wage controls were lifted,\u201d Housel noted.\nMorgan illustrates this with a fine digression: Why are people so nostalgic about the past, and was it really better than the present?\nToday\u2019s families are also far wealthier than prior generations. Housel notes the median family income adjusted for inflation:\nI put this slightly differently: Everyone has circumstances that they are living in:  how much money they make, where they live, whom they are living with, what they own.  These circumstances have a definitely external reality.  Your mortgage is very real, as is your house or apartment, as is your spouse or partner.\nDuring the 1950s, very few people lived in financial circles that were dramatically better than everyone else. Smaller houses felt fine because everyone had one.  Everyone went on camping vacations because, well, that\u2019s what everyone did.\n \u201cThe ones who thrive long term are those who understand the real world is a never-ending chain of absurdity, confusion, messy relationships, and imperfect people.\u201d\nMorgan\u2019s thesis is that the same things that have motivated men and women throughout our existence (fear, love, hate, greed, envy) are still present today, and because of that, much of what happens is perfectly predictable: Same as ever.\nThe book not only caught on, it has sold roughly 4 million copies worldwide.\nHousel ends with a series of questions the reader should be asking themselves, including \u201cWhat strong belief do I hold that\u2019s most likely to change? What\u2019s always been true? What\u2019s the same as ever?\u201d\nAnd as long as those age-old emotions that motive us don\u2019t change, the new fancy gadgets we all have are just different tools to help us engage the same old emotions.\nTo give you an idea of how big that is, a typical financial book will sell roughly 5,000 copies. If you can sell 10,000 copies, you\u2019re really doing well.\nIt was a relatively brief (250 pages) book, with short chapters, laden with Housel\u2019s folksy wisdom on savings, the power of compounding interest, and plenty of stories about the role of luck and risk, and how certain key people (like Bill Gates) got lucky breaks that enabled them to go on to greater things (in Gates\u2019 case, he had attended Lakeside High School in Seattle, one of the few high schools that had a computer at the time).\n\u201cThe valuation of every company is simply a number from today multiplied by a story about tomorrow.\u201d\nData is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutes. Global Business and Financial News, Stock Quotes, and Market Data and Analysis.\nOn one level, it was: It was possible to have a family with one wage earner to have a modest, middle-class life.\nExcept this time Housel is going for a larger audience than those who wanted financial insights: He is going for timeless wisdom that is aiming to show people how to look at life in general. \n\u201cMedian hourly wages adjusted for inflation are nearly 50 percent higher today than in 1955,\u201d Housel noted. \u201cAnd higher income wasn\u2019t due to working more hours, or entirely due to women joining the workforce in greater numbers.\u201d  It was due to gains in productivity.\n\u201cMost great things in life\u2014from love to careers to investing\u2014gain their value from two things: patience and scarcity. Patience to let something grow, and scarcity to admire what it grows into.\u201d\nManaging risk is a topic Housel addressed in The Psychology of Money, and he returns to it again.   \n\u201cIf you understand the math behind compounding you realize the most important question is not \u2018How can I earn the highest returns?\u2019 It\u2019s \u2018What are the best returns I can sustain for the longest period of time?\u2019 Little changes compounded for a long time create extraordinary changes.\u201d\n\u201cThe best financial plan is to save like a pessimist and invest like an optimist. That idea\u2014the belief that things will get better mixed with the reality that the path between now and then will be a continuous chain of setback, disappointment, surprise, and shock\u2014shows up all over history, in all areas of life.\u201d\nBeyond your current circumstances, there are needs, and there are wants.  Needs are what people require to get by: shelter, food. Wants are what people aspire to:  a bigger house, a bigger car, a bigger everything. Those wants are being dramatically inflated by the wealth gap that has opened up and is amplified by social media. \nThis nostalgia, Housel says, \u201cis one of the best examples of what happens when expectations grow faster than circumstances.\u201d\nMortality rates were much higher. People died far younger.\nTake the 1950s, which baby boomers and their parents seem to think was some kind of golden age.\nHousel comes to the same conclusion:  \u201cthe expectation side of that equation is not only important, but it\u2019s often more in your control than managing your circumstances.\u201d\nGot a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.\n\u201cThe ability to say, I want that, why don\u2019t I have that? Why does he get it but I don\u2019t? is so much greater now than it was just a few generations ago. Today\u2019s economy is good at generating three things: wealth, the ability to show off wealth, and great envy for other people\u2019s wealth.\u201d\nHere\u2019s the mental trick: While your circumstances and your needs have a definite external reality, the \u201cwants\u201d only exist in your head; they have no external reality.  You don\u2019t have to be envious of your neighbor who has the Rolex or the big house.  To the extent that is causing your envy and your anxiety, it is completely in your own control to change those thoughts.  By changing your relationship with your wants, which only exist in your head, you can change the way you view your circumstances.\n\u201cWhat kind of person is likely to go overboard, bite off more than they can chew, and discount risks that are blindingly obvious to others? Someone who is determined, optimistic, doesn\u2019t take no for an answer, and is relentlessly confident in their own abilities\u2026the same personality traits that push people to the top also increase the odds of pushing them over the edge.\u201d\nBut the idea that people were better off in the 1950s is not supported by the facts. \nHousel is a partner at The Collaborative Fund and became a best-selling author with the 2020 publication of his book, The Psychology of Money. It explored the relationship between money and human behavior. The main thesis was to maximize what you can control: managing your own expectations, knowing when was enough, how to stop changing the goalposts.\n\u00a9 2023 CNBC LLC. All Rights Reserved.

In the U.S., the most recent jobs report showed the highest unemployment rate since January 2022, credit card delinquencies are at 12-year highs, and high yield defaults are comfortably off the lows,\u201d Deutsche\u2019s Head of Global Economics and Thematic Research, Jim Reid, and Group Chief Economist David Folkerts-Landau said in the report.\nGot a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.\nJPMAM Chief Market Strategist Karen Ward noted that many U.S. households took advantage of 30-year fixed rate mortgages while rates were still around 2.7%, while in the U.K., many shifted to five-year fixed rates during the Covid-19 pandemic, meaning the \u201cpassthrough of interest rates is much slower\u201d than previous cycles.\nThe U.S. economy\u2019s resilience has fueled an emerging consensus that the Federal Reserve will achieve its desired \u201csoft landing,\u201d slowing inflation without tipping the economy into recession.\n\u201cAt the outer edges of the economy there is obvious stress that is likely to spread in 2024 with rates at these levels. In the Euro Area, Q3 saw a -0.1% decline in GDP, with the economy in a period of stagnation since Autumn 2022 that will likely extend to mid-Summer 2024.\u201d\nHowever, she highlighted that U.K. exposure to higher rates is due to rise from about 38% at the end of 2023 to 60% at the end of 2024, while first-time buyers in the U.S. will be exposed to much higher rates and the cost of other consumer debt, such as auto loans, has also risen sharply.\n\u00a9 2023 CNBC LLC.

Companies often choose pretax \u2014 not Roth \u2014 accounts as the receptacle for automatic contributions. That means workers would have to make a proactive decision to switch their allocation.\nEmployers that match 401(k) savings have historically done so in the pretax savings bucket, regardless of whether the employee contributions are pretax or Roth.

Global Business and Financial News, Stock Quotes, and Market Data and Analysis.\nRoth 401(k) contributions may not be wise for all workers. Generally, they make sense for investors who are likely in a lower tax bracket now than they expect to be when they retire, according to financial advisors.\nA Roth is a type of after-tax account. Workers pay tax up front on 401(k) contributions, but investment growth and account withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This differs from traditional pretax savings, whereby workers get a tax break upfront but pay later.\nCatch-up contributions are available to people age 50 and older. Such workers are permitted to funnel an additional $7,500 into 401(k) plans in 2024, beyond the $23,000 annual limit.\nThe recently passed retirement law, known as Secure 2.0, is also expected to increase Roth uptake in another way. It will require \u201ccatch up\u201d 401(k) contributions to be made to Roth accounts, if the worker\u2019s income exceeds $145,000 (indexed to inflation).\nThat share has increased significantly over the past decade: Just 58.2% of employers made a Roth 401(k) available in 2013, PSCA found. It also rose slightly over the past year, from 87.8% in 2021.\nFor example, investors with Roth 401(k) savings won\u2019t need to take required minimum distributions from those accounts starting in 2024. This already applies to Roth IRAs. However, the same isn\u2019t true for traditional pretax accounts: Retirees must pull funds from pretax 401(k)s and IRAs starting at age 73, even if they don\u2019t need the money.\nThere are a few reasons why usage likely doesn\u2019t correspond with overall availability.\nGot a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.\nRoth savings can also help reduce annual premiums for Medicare Part B, which are based on taxable income. Because Roth withdrawals are considered tax-free income, pulling money strategically from Roth accounts can prevent one\u2019s income from jumping over certain Medicare thresholds.\nHowever, there are some guiding principles for Roth.\n\u00a9 2023 CNBC LLC. All Rights Reserved. A Division of NBCUniversal\nSome may shun Roth savings because they assume both their spending and their tax bracket will fall when they retire. But that doesn\u2019t always happen, according to financial advisors.\nThat\u2019s because they would accumulate a larger nest egg by paying tax now at a lower tax rate.\nFor example, Roth accounts generally make sense for young people, especially those just entering the workforce, who are likely to have their highest-earning years ahead of them. Those contributions and any investment growth would then compound tax-free for decades. (One important note: Investment growth is only tax-free for withdrawals after age 59\u00bd, and provided you have had the Roth account for at least five years.)\nHowever, Roth uptake by employees remains relatively low by comparison: About 21% of workers made a Roth contribution in 2022, according to PSCA data. By comparison, 72% saved in a traditional pretax account. (Workers can opt to use either, or both.)\nEmployers must make the change by 2026.

And your current employer may not accept rollovers into your 401(k) from a previous employer\u2019s plan.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll want to look at whether your 401(k) is a good plan with diverse, low-cost investment choices and fees,\u201d said Carolyn McClanahan, a certified financial planner and founder of Life Planning Partners in Jacksonville, Florida. She is also a member of CNBC\u2019s FA Council. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t a good plan, we encourage rolling it into a new 401(k) or IRA.\u201d\nA rollover may be \u201cthe single largest transaction\u201d many people make in their life, Fred Reish, a retirement expert and partner at law firm Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath, recently told CNBC.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a quick fix,\u201d she said.  \nHere are some key details to weigh when choosing to keep money in your 401(k) or move it to an IRA.\nThe tax move is known as \u201cnet unrealized appreciation.\u201d Basically, by keeping stock in your 401(k), you\u2019d ultimately pay preferential, capital gains tax rates on any investment growth (rather than ordinary income tax rates) withdrawn in retirement. This tactic isn\u2019t an option if you roll the money into an IRA.\nData also provided by\nIRA assets may not be protected, depending on the strength of state laws.\nCertain retirement investments like annuities, physical real estate or private company stock are generally unavailable to 401(k) savers, said Ted Jenkin, a certified financial planner based in Atlanta and founder of oXYGen Financial.\nInvestors generally get stronger creditor protections in a 401(k) than an IRA, courtesy of federal law, advisors said.\nAnother consideration: While the investment options may be fewer in a 401(k), employers have a legal obligation \u2014 known as a \u201cfiduciary\u201d duty \u2014 to curate and continually monitor a list of funds that\u2019s best suited to their workers.\nData is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutes.

You can\u2019t borrow money or take a loan from an IRA.\nFor example, just 61% of 401(k) plans allowed periodic or partial withdrawals by retirees in 2022, and 55% allowed installment payments, according to the Plan Sponsor Council of America, a trade group.\nGot a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.\nThat\u2019s largely because IRA investors are \u201cretail\u201d investors while 401(k) savers often get access to more favorable \u201cinstitutional\u201d pricing. Employers pool workers into one retirement plan and have more buying power; those economies of scale generally yield cheaper annual investment fees.\nBut deciding whether a rollover makes sense isn\u2019t always straightforward: There are many factors to consider before moving the money. The Department of Labor recently proposed a regulation to improve the rollover advice investors get from brokers, insurance agents and others.\nIf this is the case, Lander advises workers to ask their employer\u2019s human resources department about the policy and whether it can be amended.\nThe bottom line: Compare annual 401(k) fees \u2014 like investment \u201cexpense ratios\u201d and administrative costs \u2014 to those of an IRA.\nRollovers to an IRA made in 2018 will cost investors an aggregate $45.5 billion over a 25-year period due to higher fund fees, according to an estimate by c.\nBut 401(k) options are limited to those selected by your employer. With an IRA, the menu is often much broader.\nYour 401(k) money would generally be protected from seizure in the event of bankruptcy or if you faced a civil suit from someone who, for example, fell and got injured in your home, Lander said.\nDon\u2019t miss these stories from CNBC PRO:\nSuch \u201crollovers\u201d are common when workers retire or take new jobs at different employers.

Noting that core inflation has run at a 2.5% annual rate over the past six months, Powell said, \u201cwhile the lower inflation readings of the past few months are welcome, that progress must continue if we are to reach our 2 percent objective.\u201d\n\u201cThe strong actions we have taken have moved our policy rate well into restrictive territory, meaning that tight monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation,\u201d Powell said. \u201cMonetary policy is thought to affect economic conditions with a lag, and the full effects of our tightening have likely not yet been felt.\u201d\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday pushed back on market expectations for aggressive interest rate cuts ahead, calling it too early to declare victory over inflation.\n\u201cHaving come so far so quickly, the FOMC is moving forward carefully, as the risks of under- and over-tightening are becoming more balanced,\u201d he said.\n\u201cInflation is still running well above target, but it\u2019s moving in the right direction,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we think the right thing to be doing now is to be moving carefully, thinking carefully about about how things are going on letting letting the data tell us what the story is. The data will tell us whether we\u2019ve done enough or whether we need to do more.\u201d\nMarket pricing Friday morning indicated that the Fed indeed is done hiking and could start cutting as soon as March 2024, according to the CME Group. Moreover, futures are pointing to cuts totaling 1.25 percentage points by the end of the year, the equivalent of five quarter percentage point reductions.\nExpectations that the Fed is done raising rates and will move to an easing posture in 2024 have helped underpin a strong Wall Street rally that has sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average up more than 8% over the past month to a new 2023 high.\nData also provided by\nPowell\u2019s remarks gave some credence to the idea that the Fed at least is done hiking as the string of rate hikes since March 2022 have cut into economic activity.\nA Commerce Department report Thursday showed that personal consumption expenditures prices, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, were up 3% from a year ago, but 3.5% at a core basis that excludes volatile food and energy prices. Recent sharp declines in energy have been responsible for much of the easing in inflation.\nAddressing the economic data, Powell characterized the labor market as \u201cvery strong,\u201d through he said a reduced pace of job creation is helping bring supply and demand back in line.\nData is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutes.

But like his friend and colleague, Munger was a font of wisdom in investing, and in life. And like one of his heroes, Benjamin Franklin, Munger\u2019s insight didn\u2019t lack humor.\nMunger donated hundreds of millions of dollars to educational institutions, including the University of Michigan, Stanford University and Harvard Law School, often with the stipulation that the school accept his building designs, even though he was not formally trained as an architect.\nTwo years later, he married Nancy Barry, whom he met on a blind date at a chicken dinner restaurant. The couple had four children, Charles Jr., Emilie, Barry and Philip. He also was the stepfather to her two other sons, William Harold Borthwick and David Borthwick. The Mungers, who were married 54 years until her death in 2010, contributed $43.5 million to Stanford University to help build the Munger Graduate Residence, which houses 600 law and graduate students.\n\u201cAny time you go to a football game or a function there\u2019s a huge line outside the women\u2019s bathroom.

It has since produced more than $2 billion in sales for Berkshire.\n\u201cHe weaned me away from the idea of buying very so-so companies at very cheap prices, knowing that there was some small profit in it, and looking for some really wonderful businesses that we could buy in fair prices,\u201d Buffett told CNBC in May 2016.\nData also provided by\nBillionaire Charlie Munger, the investing sage who made a fortune even before he became Warren Buffett\u2019s right-hand man at Berkshire Hathaway, has died at age 99.\nMunger was chairman and CEO of Wesco Financial from 1984 to 2011, when Buffett\u2019s Berkshire purchased the remaining shares of the Pasadena, California-based insurance and investment company it did not own.\n\u201cAnd staying cheerful ... because it\u2019s a wise thing to do.

(Booth, who died in 2008, had been introduced to Buffett by Munger in 1963 and became one of Berkshire\u2019s largest investors.)\nIn 1959, at age 35, Munger returned to Omaha to close his late father\u2019s legal practice.

Three years later, he became vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway.\nDuring Berkshire\u2019s 2021 annual shareholder meeting, the then-97-year-old Munger apparently inadvertently revealed a well-guarded secret: that Vice Chairman Greg Abel \u201cwill keep the culture\u201d after the Buffett era.\n\u201cWe never had an argument in the entire time we\u2019ve known each other, which is almost 60 years now,\u201d Buffett told CNBC\u2019s Becky Quick in 2018. \u201cCharlie has given me the ultimate gift that a person can give to somebody else.

In California, he fell in love with his sister\u2019s roommate at Scripps College, Nancy Huggins, and married her in 1945. Although he never completed his undergraduate degree, Munger graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law School in 1948, and the couple moved back to California, where he practiced real estate law. He founded the law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson in 1962 and focused on managing investments at the hedge fund Wheeler, Munger & Co., which he also founded that year.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have a lot of envy, you don\u2019t have a lot of resentment, you don\u2019t overspend your income, you stay cheerful in spite of your troubles. You deal with reliable people and you do what you\u2019re supposed to do. And all these simple rules work so well to make your life better. And they\u2019re so trite,\u201d he said.\nThe melding of the minds focused on value investing, in which stocks are picked because their price appears to be undervalued based on the company\u2019s long-term fundamentals.\nAt Los Angeles\u2019 Harvard-Westlake prep school, where Munger had been a board member for decades, he ensured that the girls bathrooms were larger than the boys room during the construction of the science center in the 1990s.\nAt 17, Munger left Omaha for the University of Michigan.

They constituted the bulk of overall annuity sales this year, at an estimated $140 billion.\nFinancial planners sometimes recommend them to guard against the risk of outliving one\u2019s savings \u2014 though some kinds are much better at doing so than others, they said.\nMcClanahan, founder of Life Planning Partners, generally uses single premium immediate annuities \u2014 also known as SPIAs \u2014 with clients.\nDeferred-income annuities, or DIAs, generally work the same way. However, they don\u2019t start paying right away: People might buy them in their 60s, for example, and the annuity will pay a set monthly amount in the future, perhaps in one\u2019s 70s or 80s. The income stream is generally larger than with a SPIA but carries additional uncertainty around when one might need that money.\nSuch malaise pushed consumers to seek out relative safety, in fixed-rate deferred annuities, for example. They\u2019re like certificates of deposit in annuity form, protecting principal while delivering a fixed return over a few years.\nBy comparison, they bought $71 billion of indexed annuities and $39 billion of variable annuities. Such annuities are often more complex and carry higher fees than SPIAs and DIAs, according to financial advisors. Insurance agents may also have an incentive to sell more of them to consumers because they often carry higher commissions, advisors said.\nWhile the stock market has bounced back from a dismal 2022, there\u2019s \u201cstill a lot of uneasiness with investors,\u201d who are grappling with unknowns like the trajectory of inflation and the economy, Giesing said.\nConversely, indexed and variable annuities carry so-called income riders that can offer both a future income stream and liquidity if buyers need to access their money early. However, they generally carry relatively high costs and strict rules about access, which have financial penalties if breached, planners said.\nThat would handily beat last year\u2019s record \u2014 about $311 billion \u2014 which in turn had surpassed the prior mark set amid the 2008 financial crisis, according to LIMRA.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nInflation gives millions new access to investments for the wealthy\nMiddle-class Americans want to know more about how the wealthy make money\nMore retirement savers are borrowing from their 401(k) plan\nAnnuities are issued by insurance companies.

The ability of governments to create incentives for average-income earners to save for retirement plays an important role for the health of any system.\nPortugal took the top spot on this metric with a score of 86.7 in Mercer\u2019s latest report, due to its earnings-based public pension system.

Share counts typically change because many companies have large buyback programs that reduce share count. \nUnder federal law, a diversified investment fund (mutual funds, exchange-traded funds), even if it just mimics an index like the S&P 500, has to satisfy certain diversification requirements. This includes requirements that: 1) no single issuer can account for more than 25% of the total assets of the portfolio, and 2) securities that represent more than 5% of the total assets cannot exceed 50% of the total portfolio. \nWhen these indexes are adjusted, either because of additions or deletions, or because share counts change, or because the weightings are changed to reduce the influence of the largest companies, it means a lot of money moves in and out of mutual funds and ETFs that are directly or indirectly tied to the indexes. \nGot a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.\nThis is an opportunity for the trading community to move large blocks of stock for the last gasps of tax loss harvesting or to position for the new year. Trading volume will typically drop 30%-40% in the final two weeks of the year after triple witching, with only the final trading day showing significant volume.\nMost of the major indexes have similar requirements in their rules. \nIt\u2019s arguably the biggest stock story of 2023: a small number of giant technology companies now make up a very large part of big indexes like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq-100. \nLast Friday, Nasdaq announced that six companies would be added to the Nasdaq-100: CDW Corporation\n(CDW), Coca-Cola Europacific Partners (CCEP), DoorDash\n(DASH), MongoDB\n(MDB), Roper Technologies\n(ROP), and Splunk\n(SPLK). \nThe Nasdaq-100 also uses a \u201cmodified\u201d market-capitalization weighting scheme, which can constrain the size of the weighting for any given stock to address overconcentration risk. This rebalancing may reduce the weighting in some of the largest stocks, including Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia and Alphabet. \nThe S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are rebalancing their respective indexes this Friday. While this is a routine event, some of the changes may reflect the concerns over concentration risk. \nWhether the rules around market concentration should be tightened is open for debate, but the issue has been around for decades.\nIn addition, three companies are being added to the S&P 500: Uber\n, Jabil\n, and Builders FirstSource\n.

The three largest ETFs (SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust\n, iShares Core S&P 500 ETF\n, and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF\n) are all directly indexed to the S&P 500 and collectively have nearly $1.2 trillion in assets under management. \nFor example, there are 11 S&P sector indexes that are the underlying indexes for widely traded ETFs such as the Technology Select SPDR ETF\n(XLK). The rules for these sector indexes are similar to the rules on diversification requirements for investment funds discussed above. For example, the S&P sector indexes say that a single stock cannot exceed 24% of the float-adjusted market capitalization of that sector index and that the sum of the companies with weights greater than 4.8% cannot exceed 50% of the total index weight. \nThis quarter, Apple, Alphabet, Comcast\n, Exxon Mobil\n, Visa\nand Marathon Petroleum\nwill all see their share counts reduced, so funds indexed to the S&P will have to reduce their weighting. \nAt the end of last week, three companies had weights greater than 4.8% in the Technology Select Sector (Microsoft at 23.5%, Apple at 22.8%, and Broadcom at 4.9%) and their combined market weight was 51.2%, so if those same prices hold at the close on Friday, there should be a small reduction in Apple and Microsoft in that index. \nAll of this might appear of only academic interest, but the big move to passive index investing in the past 20 years has made these events more important to investors. \nLinked to the Nasdaq-100 \u2014 the 100 largest nonfinancial companies listed on Nasdaq \u2014 the Invesco QQQ Trust\n(QQQ) is the fifth-largest ETF, with roughly $220 billion in assets under management. \nSign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox\nThe Nasdaq-100 is rebalanced four times a year; however, the annual reconstitution, where stocks are added or deleted, happens only in December. \nData is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutes.

In other tests, the models were told where the underlying SEC documents would be stored, or given \u201clong context,\u201d which meant including nearly an entire SEC filing alongside the question in the prompt.\nDon\u2019t miss these stories from CNBC PRO:\n\u201cThere just is no margin for error that\u2019s acceptable, because, especially in regulated industries, even if the model gets the answer wrong 1 out of 20 times, that\u2019s still not high enough accuracy,\u201d Qian said.\nThe founders met at Facebook parent company Meta\n, where they worked on AI problems related to understanding how models come up with their answers and making them more \u201cresponsible.\u201d They founded Patronus AI, which has received seed funding from Lightspeed Venture Partners, to automate LLM testing with software, so companies can feel comfortable that their AI bots won\u2019t surprise customers or workers with off-topic or wrong answers.\nThe ability to extract important numbers quickly and perform analysis on financial narratives has been seen as one of the most promising applications for chatbots since ChatGPT was released late last year. SEC filings are filled with important data, and if a bot could accurately summarize them or quickly answer questions about what\u2019s in them, it could give the user a leg up in the competitive financial industry.\nAn OpenAI representative pointed to the company\u2019s usage guidelines, which prohibit offering tailored financial advice using an OpenAI model without a qualified person reviewing the information, and require anyone using an OpenAI model in the financial industry to provide a disclaimer informing them that AI is being used and its limitations.

That means that companies will need to do more rigorous testing to make sure they\u2019re operating correctly, not going off-topic, and providing reliable results.\nData is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutes.

It could answer 75% of the questions it was posed, gave the wrong answer for 21%, and failed to answer only 3%. GPT-4-Turbo also did well with long context, answering 79% of the questions correctly, and giving the wrong answer for 17% of them.\nLarge language models, similar to the one at the heart of ChatGPT, frequently fail to answer questions derived from Securities and Exchange Commission filings, researchers from a startup called Patronus AI found.\nIt was able to improve significantly when given access to the underlying filings.

Of course, there\u2019s still ample uncertainty over how soon and how quickly the Fed may cut rates this time around.\nBonds got clobbered by the Fed\u2019s interest-rate-hiking cycle.\nThat\u2019s because bond prices move opposite to interest rates. It\u2019s like a seesaw: When interest rates rise, bond prices fall.\nAs with any of these recommendations, it\u2019s important to make investment decisions within the construct of a diversified portfolio, Fitzgerald said.\nThose with a strong conviction that interest rates will fall may consider buying funds with a longer maturity, which would generally benefit more from declining rates, Jenkin said. However, they also carry more risk, he said.  \nMore from Personal Finance:\n2024 is the \u2018year of globetrotting.\u2019 Here are some of the hot spots\nHere are some moves investors can make when the market is soaring\n4 factors that affect how much Social Security income retirees will get in 2024\nHold an adequate amount of stocks in your portfolio relative to your age and time horizon, be disciplined and don\u2019t freak out if and when the market goes down, he added.\n\u201cIf anyone was trying to time the market, they may have missed it already,\u201d added Fitzgerald, a founding member of Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo. \u201cBecause it\u2019s what happened in the fourth quarter.\u201d\nHere\u2019s what financial advisors say investors need to know.\nFor investors who buy, it would perhaps make more sense to do it in a retirement account like an individual retirement account or 401(k) plan, so the dividends aren\u2019t taxable until later, Jenkin said.\nThe central bank\u2019s latest summary of economic projections, issued in December, indicates three cuts may be coming this year. This assumes each is a quarter-percentage-point decrease.\nAn environment of gradually falling interest rates \u201cis an easy place to make money in the bond market without a whole bunch of risk,\u201d Fitzgerald said.\nThe Fed began raising borrowing costs aggressively in March 2022 to tame inflation. Inflation has since declined significantly from pandemic-era highs, and keeping interest rates too elevated risks tipping the U.S. into recession.\nThe S&P 500 U.S. stock index rose 24% in 2023 following a year-end rally. That surge was partly forward-looking, reflecting investors\u2019 expectations for lower interest rates in 2024.\nOf course, that doesn\u2019t mean all market growth is in the rearview mirror. But don\u2019t make the mistake of buying stocks with the expectation of them continuing to rise, he said. That tendency is called recency bias.\n\u201cIf you can lock in CD rates [at current levels], this is probably a good time to do it,\u201d Jenkin said. \u201cThere are still a lot of places that offer 5%.\u201d\nThe REIT sector \u201cdepends highly on the debt market to carry out business activities,\u201d and such companies therefore \u201cbenefit from lower borrowing costs,\u201d according to Zacks Equity Research.\nSign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox\nGet this delivered to your inbox, and more info about our products and services. \nFalling interest rates are generally a boon for the stock market, advisors said. Among the reasons: Businesses can borrow money more cheaply and are more likely to make big investments in their companies as a result.\nCash and cash-like investments \u2014 such as high-yield savings accounts, money market funds and certificates of deposit \u2014 were among the big beneficiaries of rising interest rates. Rates on cash jumped to their highest level in years.\nThat said, growth stocks like those in the technology sector are more likely to benefit from lower interest rates than value stocks, said Ted Jenkin, CFP, the founder of oXYGen Financial in Atlanta and a member of CNBC\u2019s Advisor Council.\nHowever, those rates are likely to fall once the Fed starts cutting borrowing costs.\nThe share prices of bond mutual funds and exchange-traded funds sank in 2022, the worst-ever year for U.S. bonds.\nSavers aren\u2019t getting much more interest on longer-term CDs, like those with a five-year term, versus a shorter-term, one-year CD, for example \u2014 so it may make more sense to opt for one with a shorter term, Jenkin said.\nHowever, 2024 is unlikely to see a repeat of stocks\u2019 stellar performance from last year, advisors said.\nReal estate investment trusts are also poised to do well amid falling interest rates, Jenkin said.\nGot a confidential news tip?

And you can see the case for that.\u201d\n\u201cLonger-term rates have dropped recently, which could stimulate demand in interest-sensitive sectors like housing,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile you might think this would be a first-class problem, strong demand isn\u2019t the solution to above-target inflation. That\u2019s why the potential for additional rate hikes remains on the table.\u201d\nAlong with that decision, committee members penciled in three quarter-percentage point rate cuts in 2024. That\u2019s a less aggressive path than market pricing indicates, but still represents an important policy pivot from a Fed that had hiked 11 times for a total of 5.25 percentage points since March 2022.

In that case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled that the SEC had already approved a futures-based bitcoin product and that it failed to explain why it had refused to approve a spot-bitcoin product. The court said, in essence, the futures and the spot market are \u201clike\u201d products. If the SEC approved one, it logically had to approve the other. \nGrayscale Bitcoin Trust currently charges 2% but has said it\u2019s committed to lowering the fee once its application to convert to a bitcoin ETF is approved. \nCrypto investors are eagerly awaiting an imminent ruling from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that will likely approve the trading of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund, more than a decade after initial attempts were rejected. \n2) Approval of S-1. This is a filing to register a new security with the SEC, in a document that provides information about the specific security. In this case, each company filing for the spot bitcoin ETF has differences in the way the product might be structured. In the case of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, an S-3 filing must be approved, which is a simplified security registration form for businesses that have met other reporting requirements. \nThe SEC sued Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao last June, alleging that Binance and Zhao \u201cengaged in an extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure, and calculated evasion of the law,\u201d according to Gensler.\nIt\u2019s widely anticipated that once the 19b-4 filings are approved, the SEC will separately approve the S-1 applications of all the ETF applicants at once. However, because the applications are different, that is not a slam dunk. The SEC may decide to approve some, but not all, of the S-1s. \nThe case is ongoing, but in November, the U.S. Department of Justice settled different charges against Binance and Zhao, wherein Zhao pleaded guilty to money laundering violations and agreed to pay a $50 million fine and step down from his role as the company\u2019s chief executive.

(It costs U.S. citizens $80.90 and lasts for 10 years.)\nBy comparison, it took six to eight weeks for routine service and two to three weeks for expedited service before the Covid-19 pandemic. The State Department has returned to that pre-pandemic norm, it announced Dec. 18.\nHere\u2019s the reason for the rule: When traveling to Europe, for example, a valid U.S. passport allows tourists to stay for up to 90 days without a visa.

Also, the Labor Department reported that the employment cost index, a gauge the Fed watches closely for signals of inflation coming through wages, increased just 0.9% in the fourth quarter, the smallest rise since the second quarter of 2021.\n\nMore broadly, inflation as measured through core personal consumption expenditures prices rose 2.9% in December from the prior year, the lowest since March 2021.

It\u2019s not that we\u2019re looking for better data, we\u2019re looking for a continuation of the good data we\u2019ve been seeing,\u201d he added.\nDuring Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s news conference, he said policymakers are waiting to see additional data to verify that the trends are continuing. He also noted that a March rate cut is unlikely.\nDon\u2019t miss these stories from CNBC PRO:\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve on Wednesday sent a tepid signal that it is done raising interest rates but made it clear that it is not ready to start cutting, with a March move lower increasingly unlikely.\nWhile the committee\u2019s statement did condense the factors that policymakers would consider when assessing policy, it did not explicitly rule out more increases. One notable change was removing as a consideration the lagged effects of monetary policy. Officials largely believe it takes at least 12 to 18 months for adjustments to take effect; the Fed last hiked in July 2023 after starting the tightening cycle in March 2022.\n\u201cIn considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,\u201d the statement said. That language replaced a bevy of factors including \u201cthe cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.\u201d\nHowever, it also said there are no plans yet to cut rates with inflation still running above the central bank\u2019s target. The statement further provided limited guidance that it was done hiking, only outlining factors that will go into \u201cadjustments\u201d to policy.\nIn a substantially changed statement that concluded the central bank\u2019s two-day meeting this week, the Federal Open Market Committee removed language that had indicated a willingness to keep raising interest rates until inflation had been brought under control and was on its way toward the Fed\u2019s 2% inflation goal. \n\u201cThe Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance,\u201d the FOMC missive said. \u201cThe economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks.\u201c\n\nGone from the statement was a key clause that had referenced \u201cthe extent of any additional policy firming\u201d that might come. Some Fed watchers had been looking for language to emphasize that additional rate hikes were unlikely, but the statement left the question at least somewhat open.\n\nGoing into the meeting, markets had expected the Fed could begin reducing its benchmark overnight borrowing rate as soon as March, with May also a possible launching point. Immediately after the decision, stocks fell to session lows.\n\nPolicymakers, though, have been more circumspect about their intentions, cautioning that they see no need to move quickly as they watch the data unfold. Committee members in December indicated a likelihood of three quarter-percentage point rate cuts this year, less ambitious than the six that futures markets are pricing, according to the CME Group.\n\nMore immediately, the committee, for the fourth consecutive time, unanimously voted not to raise the fed funds rate. The key rate is targeted in a range between 5.25%-5.5%, the highest in nearly 23 years.\n\nThe Fed has been riding a wave of decelerating inflation, a strong labor market and solid economic growth, giving it both leeway to start easing up on monetary policy and caution about growth that could reaccelerate and drive prices higher again. Along with 11 rate hikes, the Fed also has been allowing its bond holdings to roll off, a process that has shaved more than $1.2 trillion off the central bank balance sheet. The statement indicated that the balance sheet runoff will continue apace.\nThose changes were part of an overhaul in which the Fed seeks to chart a course ahead, with inflation moving lower and economic growth proving resilient. The statement indicated that economic growth has been \u201csolid\u201d and noted the progress made on inflation."}, {"title": "Stocks making the biggest moves midday: Alphabet, Boeing, Microsoft and more", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/31/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-midday-googl-ba-amd-msft-para.html", "date": "2024-01-31", "text": "\nGot a confidential news tip?

In a client note, the firm said it also figures the committee could borrow a line from the December meeting minutes indicating it would \u201cbe appropriate for policy to remain at a restrictive stance until inflation is clearly moving down sustainably toward the Committee\u2019s objective.\u201d\n\u201cWe heard at the December meeting that no official expected to raise rates further as a baseline outcome. And we\u2019ve heard that Fed officials are beginning the discussions around rate cuts,\u201d Matthew Luzzetti, Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief U.S. economist, said in an interview. \u201cSo getting rid of that explicit tightening bias is kind of a precondition to more actively thinking about when they might cut rates, and to leaving the door open for a March rate cut.\u201d\nOfficials will be weighing the balance of inflation that is declining against economic growth that has held stronger than anticipated. Gross domestic product grew at an annualized pace of 3.3% in the fourth quarter, lower than the previous period but well ahead of where Fed officials figured it would be at this stage.\nHowever, a restrictive stance isn\u2019t the same as holding rates where they are now, and that kind of linguistic move would give the committee wiggle room to cut.\nFollow our live coverage of today\u2019s Fed meeting\nIn its post-meeting statement, the central bank is expected give an important hint about interest rate moves to come by removing a clause from previous statements that reads: \u201cIn determining the extent of any additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time,\u201d followed by an outlining of conditions it assesses.\nJust a few weeks ago, futures markets were convinced the Fed would start in March, assigning a nearly 90% probability to such a move, according to the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch gauge. Now, there\u2019s considerably more uncertainty as multiple statements from Fed officials point to a more cautious approach about declaring victory over inflation.\n\u201cThe main thing that they will probably want to do is gain a lot of optionality,\u201d said Bill English, the former head of monetary affairs at the Fed and now a finance professor at the Yale School of Management. \u201cThat would mean saying something rather vague at this point [such as] we\u2019re determining the stance of policy that may be appropriate or something like that.\u201d\nWhile the market has accepted for months that the Fed is likely done raising rates, the most burning question is when it will start cutting. The Fed last hiked in July 2023. Since then, inflation numbers have drifted lower and are, by one measure, less than a percentage point away from the central bank\u2019s 2% 12-month target.\nFor the past year-plus, the wording has underlined the Fed\u2019s willingness to keep raising interest rates until it reaches its inflation goal. Remove that clause and it opens the door to potential rate cuts ahead; keep it and policymakers will be sending a signal that they\u2019re not sure what\u2019s to come.\nPost-meeting statements going back to at least late 2022 have used the \u201cin determining the extent of any additional policy firming\u201d phrasing or similar verbiage to indicate the FOMC\u2019s resolve in tightening monetary policy to bring down inflation.\nHowever, most of the public statements that officials have delivered in recent days point away from a hurry to cut.

Employees can cover any short-term expenses that might arise before payday \u2014 maybe an unexpected car repair or medical bill \u2014 perhaps for lower fees than they would incur using credit cards, bank overdrafts or other ways to access quick cash.\nConsumer fees for EWA use can take many forms.\nAn EarnIn spokesperson said its average \u201cvoluntary payment\u201d is $1.47.\nFees can add up, particularly for users who frequently access their paychecks early, experts said.\nThird-party apps are similar but instead issue funds based on estimated or historical earnings and then automatically debit a user\u2019s bank account on payday, experts said.\nIn addition, workers may pay a $2.99 to $4.99 fee if they opt to more quickly transfer cash to a debit card from a digital wallet that stores their early accessed wages, Siddiqi said. They may also pay to access cash from out-of-network ATMs.\nTotal fees translate to an annual percentage rate of more than 330% for the average earned wage access user \u2014 a rate comparable to payday lenders, according to the California report. It analyzed data from seven anonymous companies across business models and fee structures.\nMillions of American workers are paying for early access to their paychecks. In some cases, it can come with a steep price.\nFintech companies debuted the earliest iterations more than 15 years ago. But business has boomed in recent years, accelerated by household financial burdens imposed by the Covid-19 pandemic and high inflation, experts said.\nSome programs, depending on how consumers use them, may grant that early paycheck access free of charge. Further, 28% of users \u2014 who tend to be lower earners, hourly workers and subprime borrowers \u2014 said they turned to alternative financial services such as payday loans less frequently than before using earned wage access, according to the Harvard paper.\nUnlike direct-to-consumer apps, the B2B model allows \u201cfull transparency\u201d into how much employees have worked and earned, said Stacy Greiner, COO of DailyPay, which has more than 1,000 employer clients.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nMany Americans can\u2019t pay an unexpected $1,000 expense\nWhy the \u2018last mile\u2019 of the inflation fight may be hard\nPaying rent usually won\u2019t boost your credit score\nGot a confidential news tip?

For example, three companies, Dave, EarnIn and Brigit, report a \u201chighly significant\u201d user base of about 14 million combined, it said. MoneyLion is another market leader, according to Datos Insights.\nBig companies such as Dollar Tree, Kroger, Hilton, McDonald\u2019s, Target, Uber and Walmart now also offer employees early access to paychecks.\nMeanwhile, 80% of consumer program transactions are between $40 and $100, on average, according to a 2023 analysis by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation. Amounts generally range from 6% to 50% of a worker\u2019s paycheck.\n\u2033[These] are agreements to receive money now and pay it back in the future, either without \u2014 or much more frequently with \u2014 an additional fee paid to the lender,\u201d she added. \u201cIn every other context, we call such an agreement a loan, and fintech cash advances are no different.\u201d\nA MoneyLion spokesperson said direct-to-consumer providers help gig and freelance workers, small business employees, union and public-sector workers and others \u201csmooth out cash flows between pay cycles to gain better control over their finances.\u201d\nHowever, data suggests the average user can accrue significant costs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a common misconception,\u201d said Phil Goldfeder, CEO of the American Fintech Council, a trade group. \u201cEWA is not a loan or an advance. It\u2019s access to the money you\u2019ve already earned,\u201d not future earnings, he said.\nData is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutes. Global Business and Financial News, Stock Quotes, and Market Data and Analysis.\n\u201cIt\u2019s another version of payday loans,\u201d Monica Burks, policy counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending, a consumer advocacy group, said of earned wage access. \u201cThere\u2019s really no meaningful difference.\u201d\nEmployer models may charge per transaction, or for \u201cexpedited\u201d delivery whereby users get their money faster \u2014 maybe $2 for receipt within a day or $10 within an hour, instead of for free within a few days, according to the Harvard paper.\nBranch, DailyPay and Payactiv are among the \u201cmost significant\u201d B2B companies, according to a recent paper published by the Harvard Kennedy School and co-authored by Lux and research assistant Cherie Chung.\nAdditionally, 40% of people with employer-sponsored EWA access use the service at least once a week, and more than 75% used money for regular bills instead of emergency expenses, according to the Harvard paper. Liquidity issues most often affect low-income households, which have less savings and less access to traditional credit, it said.\nHigh fees and user dependency \u201care kind of the darker side of the business,\u201d said Peterson of Datos Insights.\nA chief concern is that consumers can use multiple apps concurrently and take on more debt than they can handle, according to Datos Insights. Among direct-to-consumer app users, 8% had five or more such apps currently on their phone, according to the Harvard paper.\nSimilarly, Payactiv, another B2B firm, makes a \u201csignificant portion\u201d of revenue from interchange fees, said CEO Safwan Shah.\nThose tips can start to add up. For example, about 40% of EarnIn\u2019s annual revenue comes from tips, Ben LaRocco, the company\u2019s senior director of government relations, said in testimony before the Vermont House Committee on Commerce and Economic Development.\nHowever, some consumer advocates and state regulators have the opposite view.\nGet this delivered to your inbox, and more info about our products and services.\n\u00a9 2024 CNBC LLC. All Rights Reserved. \nA Division of NBCUniversal\nThe typical user earns less than $50,000 a year, according to the GAO.\nData also provided by\nThe B2B model uses employers\u2019 payroll and time-sheet records to track the users\u2019 accrued earnings. When payday arrives, the employee receives the portion of pay that hasn\u2019t been tapped early.\nWhile such a distinction may seem like unimportant minutiae, the label could have a significant consumer impact. For example, being regulated as a loan would mean being subject to caps on interest rates and more fee transparency via disclosure of how consumer costs translate into an annual interest rate, or APR, experts said.\nAn EarnIn spokesperson called EWA a \u201cno risk option\u201d that avoids a negative impact to credit scores since it doesn\u2019t require credit checks or credit reporting.\nThat said, the products pose a few consumer risks, including lack of cost transparency, the study found.\nBranch, a B2B company, for example, makes most of its money from an optional debit card. The card is free for consumers but levies a transaction, or \u201cinterchange,\u201d fee on businesses when consumers make purchases, said CEO Atif Siddiqi.\nEarned wage access goes by various names: daily pay, instant pay, accrued wage access, same-day pay and on-demand pay, for example.\nHowever, it\u2019s \u201cthe exception, certainly not the rule,\u201d he added.\nUsers who opt not to use Payactiv\u2019s debit card pay a $1.99 or $2.99 flat fee per transaction. Since the worker is tapping wages they\u2019ve technically already earned, such a transaction fee is akin to an ATM fee, Shah said.\nThere also aren\u2019t credit checks, accrued interest, late fees or debt collection associated with such programs, for example, Goldfeder said.\nWhile there can be various benefits for consumers \u2014 like quick access to funds in the event of an emergency \u2014 some services share characteristics of high-cost debt such as payday loans that can cause financial harm, according to some experts and consumer advocates.\nCompanies in the B2B market often tout themselves as a win-win for employers and for their employees who use the services.\nSign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox\nSuch programs aren\u2019t new.\nSince direct-to-consumer companies generally automatically debit user bank accounts, consumers without sufficient funds may also pay unexpected overdraft fees, the GAO said.\n\u201cWe as human beings incur expenses every day,\u201d said Thad Peterson, strategic advisor at Datos Insights. \u201cBut we\u2019re only paid on a periodic basis. That\u2019s a massive inconsistency, especially when there\u2019s technology that allows it to go away.\u201d\nAnd while companies monetize their businesses in various ways, they always offer a free option to consumers, Margowsky said.\nConsumers who overextend themselves \u201ccan end up in the black hole of payday lending,\u201d Peterson said.\nThe earned wage access industry doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to use APRs and interest rate proxies to describe their fee structures.\n\u201cWhen used properly ... it\u2019s great,\u201d said Marshall Lux, a banking and technology expert and former senior fellow at Harvard University.\n\u201cWe feel we are closer to an ATM. You deposited money in the bank and are taking it out,\u201d Shah said.\n\u201cIf someone signs up in an emergency, they might not be able to wait and would want to get the money instantly,\u201d she said. \u201cThat would typically cost a fee.\u201d\nBroadly, the EWA industry doesn\u2019t publicly share the percentage of paid transactions relative to those that are free \u2014 \u201cbut I suspect it\u2019s a lot\u201d that are incurring a charge, said Harvard\u2019s Chung.\nSo-called \u201cearned wage access\u201d programs, which operate either directly to the consumer or through employers, let workers tap a portion of their wages before payday, often for a fee. The services have ballooned in popularity.\nHowever, a recent study by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that earned wage access products \u201cgenerally cost less than typical costs associated with payday loans.\u201d\n\u201cIt is inaccurate to compare an optional $1 or $2 fee \u2014 whether that\u2019s a voluntary tip or fee to expedite a transaction \u2014 to mandatory fees and compounding interest rates charged by other short-term lenders,\u201d said Miranda Margowsky, a spokeswoman for the Financial Technology Association, a trade group.\nThe industry is also loath to refer to early paycheck access as a \u201cloan\u201d or \u201ccredit.\u201d\nIn the employer-sponsored market, $9.5 billion in wages was accessed early during 2020, triple the $3.2 billion in 2018, according to the latest data from Datos Insights, a consulting firm. The number of transactions also increased threefold over that period, to 55.8 million transactions from 18.6 million, it found.\nDirect-to-consumer models may also charge subscription fees, which can range from perhaps $5 to $10 a month, the paper said. Users can also tip. While tips are voluntary, apps may default consumers to tip a certain percentage per transaction, it said. \nConsumer risks are generally greater in the direct-to-consumer rather than the business-to-business market, according to both Peterson and Harvard\u2019s Lux.\nThe average user did so nine times a quarter, according to California regulators.\nThe programs fall into two general camps: business-to-business models offered through an employer and direct-to-consumer versions.\nAmong tip-based providers, consumers tipped on 73% of transactions, California regulators found. The average was $4.09.\nRepresentatives for Brigit and Dave declined to comment."}, {"title": "Stock market to \u2018nowhere?\u2019 Two ETF experts see more trouble ahead in China", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/27/stock-market-to-nowhere-experts-see-more-trouble-ahead-in-china.html", "date": "2024-01-27", "text": "\nThe Hang Seng Index\nis down more than 6% this year and almost 30% over the past 52 weeks.\nGot a confidential news tip?

Fed Chair Jerome Powell a week ago and again during a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview that aired Sunday on CBS all but completely took a March cut off the table and said he expects policymakers to move carefully as they measure the progress of inflation against broader economic growth.\nEarlier this week, he penned an essay that ran on the Minneapolis Fed site where he suggested that the real fed funds rate when adjusted for inflation may not be as high as it looks. In a series of hikes that ran from March 2022 to July 2023, the FOMC took its benchmark overnight borrowing rate from near zero to a target range between 5.25%-5.5%, the highest in 23 years.\n\u201cAll of these metrics are very strong, and inflation is coming down. So I\u2019m very supportive of being patient to get to where we need to get,\u201d he added. \u201cI see at this point, the trade off, which is coming into better balance, is still being in favor of continuing to work on inflation.\u201d\nWith all that in mind, however, Kugler wants more confidence that it\u2019s time to cut rates.\nData also provided by\nHowever, Collins did not put a timetable on when it might be appropriate to cut rates.

Additionally, she sees indications that firms which raised their prices frequently during the big inflation run-up of 2021-22 are doing so less now.\n\u201cWhile heartened by the progress to date, I will need to see more evidence before considering adjusting the policy stance,\u201d Collins said remarks for a speech to the Boston Economic Club. \u201cAs we gain more confidence in the economy achieving the Committee\u2019s goals, and consistent with the last set of projections from FOMC participants, I believe it will likely become appropriate to begin easing policy restraint later this year.\u201d\n\u201cAt some point, the continued cooling of inflation and labor markets may make it appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate,\u201d Kugler added. \u201cOn the other hand, if progress on disinflation stalls, it may be appropriate to hold the target range steady at its current level for longer to ensure continued progress on our dual mandate.\u201d\nThere are multiple Fed speakers during the day.

One notable change was removing as a consideration the lagged effects of monetary policy. Officials largely believe it takes at least 12 to 18 months for adjustments to take effect; the Fed last hiked in July 2023 after starting the tightening cycle in March 2022.\nData is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutes. Global Business and Financial News, Stock Quotes, and Market Data and Analysis.\nIn a substantially changed statement that concluded the central bank\u2019s two-day meeting this week, the Federal Open Market Committee removed language that had indicated a willingness to keep raising interest rates until inflation had been brought under control and was on its way toward the Fed\u2019s 2% inflation goal. \nSeparate reports Wednesday indicated that the labor market is softening, but so are wages. Payrolls processing firm ADP reported that private companies added just 107,000 new workers in January, a number that was below market expectations but still indicative of an expanding labor market. Also, the Labor Department reported that the employment cost index, a gauge the Fed watches closely for signals of inflation coming through wages, increased just 0.9% in the fourth quarter, the smallest rise since the second quarter of 2021.\n\nMore broadly, inflation as measured through core personal consumption expenditures prices rose 2.9% in December from the prior year, the lowest since March 2021. On a six- and three-month basis, core PCE prices both ran at or below the Fed\u2019s target.\n\nIn a separate matter, the Fed also announced it was altering its investment policy both for high-ranking officials and staff. The changes expand the scope of those covered to include anyone with access to \u201cconfidential FOMC information\u201d and said some staff might be required to submit brokerage statements or other documents to verify the accuracy of disclosures.\n\nThe changes follow controversy over multiple Fed officials trading from private accounts at a time when the central bank was making major changes to policy in the early days of the Covid pandemic.\nThose changes were part of an overhaul in which the Fed seeks to chart a course ahead, with inflation moving lower and economic growth proving resilient. The statement indicated that economic growth has been \u201csolid\u201d and noted the progress made on inflation.\nHowever, it also said there are no plans yet to cut rates with inflation still running above the central bank\u2019s target. The statement further provided limited guidance that it was done hiking, only outlining factors that will go into \u201cadjustments\u201d to policy.\n\u201cThe Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance,\u201d the FOMC missive said. \u201cThe economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks.\u201c\n\nGone from the statement was a key clause that had referenced \u201cthe extent of any additional policy firming\u201d that might come. Some Fed watchers had been looking for language to emphasize that additional rate hikes were unlikely, but the statement left the question at least somewhat open.\n\nGoing into the meeting, markets had expected the Fed could begin reducing its benchmark overnight borrowing rate as soon as March, with May also a possible launching point. Immediately after the decision, stocks fell to session lows.\n\nPolicymakers, though, have been more circumspect about their intentions, cautioning that they see no need to move quickly as they watch the data unfold. Committee members in December indicated a likelihood of three quarter-percentage point rate cuts this year, less ambitious than the six that futures markets are pricing, according to the CME Group.\n\nMore immediately, the committee, for the fourth consecutive time, unanimously voted not to raise the fed funds rate. The key rate is targeted in a range between 5.25%-5.5%, the highest in nearly 23 years.\n\nThe Fed has been riding a wave of decelerating inflation, a strong labor market and solid economic growth, giving it both leeway to start easing up on monetary policy and caution about growth that could reaccelerate and drive prices higher again. Along with 11 rate hikes, the Fed also has been allowing its bond holdings to roll off, a process that has shaved more than $1.2 trillion off the central bank balance sheet. The statement indicated that the balance sheet runoff will continue apace.\nMarkets initially took the news in stride but slid following Powell\u2019s comments casting doubt on a March cut. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surrendered more than 300 points in the session while Treasury yields plunged. Futures pricing also swung, with the market assigning about a 64% chance the Fed would stay put at its March 19-20 meeting, according to CME Group calculations.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve on Wednesday sent a tepid signal that it is done raising interest rates but made it clear that it is not ready to start cutting, with a March move lower increasingly unlikely.\nGot a confidential news tip?

The Fed last hiked in July 2023. Since then, inflation numbers have drifted lower and are, by one measure, less than a percentage point away from the central bank\u2019s 2% 12-month target.\nThe fed funds rate, currently targeted in a range between 5.25% and 5.5%, is restrictive by historical standards and looks even more so as inflation drops and the \u201creal\u201d rate rises. The inflation rate judged by core personal consumption expenditures prices, a U.S. Department of Commerce measure that the Fed favors, indicates the real funds rate to be around 2.4%. Fed officials figure the long-run real rate to be closer to 0.5%.\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to get a lot of data between the January and March meetings, particularly as it relates to inflation,\u201d Luzzetti said. \u201cHow those data come in will be critical to determining the outcomes of future meetings.

Gross domestic product grew at an annualized pace of 3.3% in the fourth quarter, lower than the previous period but well ahead of where Fed officials figured it would be at this stage.\nYet, Goldman Sachs economists said they figure the Fed will \u201cremove the now outdated hiking bias\u201d from the post-meeting statement and set the stage for a cut in March and five total on the year. In a client note, the firm said it also figures the committee could borrow a line from the December meeting minutes indicating it would \u201cbe appropriate for policy to remain at a restrictive stance until inflation is clearly moving down sustainably toward the Committee\u2019s objective.\u201d\n\u201cIn effect, that\u2019s saying that they\u2019re more likely to be raising than cutting,\u201d English said of the clause. \u201cI guess they don\u2019t think that\u2019s really true. So I would think they\u2019d want to be ready to cut rates in March if it seems appropriate when they get there.\u201d\nJust a few weeks ago, futures markets were convinced the Fed would start in March, assigning a nearly 90% probability to such a move, according to the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch gauge.

Their so-called \u201creal earnings\u201d \u2014 earnings after accounting for inflation \u2014 were negative for more than two years.\nConsumer sentiment jumped 13% in January to its highest level since July 2021, which reflects \u201cimprovements in the outlook for both inflation and personal incomes,\u201d according to the University of Michigan.\nNow, supply chains and consumer demand for goods have largely normalized, Bryson said.\nData also provided by\n\u201cNotable\u201d categories include motor vehicle insurance (where costs are up 20.6% in the past year), recreation (2.8%), personal care (5.3%) and medical care (1.1%), according to the Labor Department.\nIt was a \u201cdouble whammy\u201d that caused prices to \u201cskyrocket,\u201d according to Jay Bryson, chief economist for Wells Fargo Economics.\nNormalizing inflation means consumers don\u2019t need to spend down their \u201cexcess savings\u201d to support spending, according to a recent outlook authored by J.P. Morgan\u2019s Global Investment Strategy Group.\nUltimately, it\u2019s likely just a \u201cbrief detour\u201d from the broader disinflation trend, which is unlikely to move in a perfectly straight line, he added.\nInflation in the \u201cservices\u201d side of the economy \u2014 the intangible things we consume, such as concerts, auto repairs and veterinary visits \u2014 is also declining but remains elevated, he said.

Their prices are up by 29%, 7.2% and 10.7%, respectively.\nBusinesses\u2019 demand for workers rose to a record high as the economy reopened, and wage growth jumped to its highest level in decades as workers enjoyed ample leverage in the job market. That growth has since eased as the labor market has cooled from red-hot levels, reducing the inflationary pressure for services, but remains elevated, economists said.\nWhile that overall downward trend is encouraging, there were a few \u201cdisappointments\u201d under the surface, as inflation rose from December to January in categories such as shelter, food, electricity and airline fares, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nWhy the \u2018last mile\u2019 of inflation fight may be tough\nWhy disinflation is \u2018more ideal\u2019 than deflation\nWorkers may be unfairly sour on the job market\nEconomists expect housing inflation to moderate due to encouraging signals, such as moderating national prices for newly signed leases, a trend that tends to take months to flow into broader inflation data.\nSugar is a key ingredient in, among other things, juices and drinks; the latter were also affected by bad weather in Brazil and Florida, which reduced production of oranges and led futures on frozen concentrated orange juice to surge to an all-time high in November, Smith said. And beef production was down almost 5% in 2023, due partly to the impact of severe drought on pasture lands, she added.\nDespite broad disinflation, there are specific categories where inflation remains relatively high.\nOther categories have retreated significantly.\n\u201cEverything suggests that\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Zandi said. \u201cThe lag is longer than I would have anticipated.\u201d\nGet this delivered to your inbox, and more info about our products and services.\nMeanwhile, overall energy costs have decreased, or deflated, by 4.6% in the past year, with gasoline down 6.4%, natural gas 17.8% and fuel oil 14.2%.\nPrices for motor vehicle insurance and auto repairs, for example, have risen rapidly following an earlier pandemic-era surge in prices for new and used cars, albeit with a lag.\nSugar prices, for example, were affected by \u201congoing shortfalls and availability issues\u201d in 2023, said Amy Smith, an economist at Advanced Economic Solutions.\nThat dynamic has reversed: Workers\u2019 hourly pay has exceeded the rate of inflation since May.

By law, employers can cash out the small account balances of former employees who leave their 401(k) accounts behind. They can do so without workers\u2019 consent and send them a check.\nHowever, a law passed that year \u2014 the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act \u2014 was among the early steps to keep more of those funds in the retirement system.\nWhile that IRA workaround preserves more money in the retirement system, it\u2019s an imperfect solution, experts said. For example, when rolled over, assets are generally held in cash-like investments such as money market funds, until investors decide to invest those assets differently. There, they earn relatively little interest while fees whittle away at the balance.\nIt\u2019s not just workers who benefit: Administrators keep more money in the 401(k) ecosystem, likely padding their profits.\nIn the meantime, workers who suspect they may have left behind an account have a few options to reclaim it, according to the Labor spokesperson:\nAt 70% market coverage, auto portability is expected to reconnect about 3 million people a year with 401(k) accounts they left behind upon job change, Williams said. The largest benefits accrue to young workers, low earners, minorities and women, the groups most likely to cash out and have the smallest balances, he said.  \nThe 401(k) ecosystem would have almost $2 trillion more over a 40-year period if workers didn\u2019t cash out their accounts, EBRI estimated.\nAuto portability is essentially a \u201cvery large exchange mechanism\u201d within the 401(k) industry, said Williams, who\u2019s also president and CEO of Portability Services Network, the entity facilitating these transactions.

While Fairbank said he expects the deal to be closed in late 2024 or early 2025, industry experts said it was impossible to know whether it will be blocked by regulators, like a string of high-profile takeovers among banks, airlines and tech companies.\nThe Discover deal\u2019s survival may hinge on whether it\u2019s seen as boosting an also-ran payments network, or allowing an already-dominant card lender to level up in size \u2014 another reason Fairbank may have played up the importance of the network.\nBy 2027, the bank expects to add at least $175 billion in payments and 25 million of its cardholders onto the Discover network.\n\u201cOwning a network allows us to deal more directly with merchants rather than a network intermediary,\u201d Fairbank told analysts. \u201cWe create more value for merchants, small businesses and consumers and capture the additional economics from vertical integration.\u201d\nCapital One intends to boost the Discover network, which carried $550 billion in transactions last year, by quickly switching all of its debit volume there, as well as a growing share of its credit card flows over time.\nThe Capital One-Discover combination could fortify the company against another potential threat \u2014 from Washington.\nIn this article\nOn Tuesday, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts urged regulators to swiftly block the deal, calling it \u201cdangerous.\u201d Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said he would be watching the deal to \u201censure that this merger doesn\u2019t enrich shareholders and executives at the expense of consumers and small businesses.\u201d\nThe deal, if approved, enables Capital One to leapfrog JPMorgan as the biggest credit card company by loans, and solidifies its position as the third largest by purchase volume. It also adds heft to Capital One\u2019s banking operations with $109 billion in total deposits from Discover\u2019s digital bank and helps the combined entity shave $1.5 billion in expenses by 2027.\nBut its growth has relied on Visa and Mastercard, which accounted for the vast majority of payment volumes last year, processing nearly $10 trillion in the U.S. between them.\nCapital One aims to deepen relationships with merchants by showing them how to boost sales, helping them prevent fraud and providing data insights, Fairbank said Tuesday, all of which makes them harder to dislodge. It can use some of the network fees to create new loyalty plans, like debit rewards programs, or underwrite merchant incentives or experiences, according to analysts.\nBy creating an end-to-end ecosystem that is more of a closed loop between shoppers and merchants, it could fend off competition from rapidly mutating fintech players like Block\nand PayPal\n, as well as buy now, pay later firms like Affirm\nand Klarna, who have made inroads with both businesses and consumers.\n\u201cThis deal gives the company a stronger hand to battle other banks, fintechs and big tech companies,\u201d said Sanjay Sakhrani, the veteran KBW retail finance analyst. \u201cThe more that they can separate themselves from the pack, the more they can future-proof themselves.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a capability that technology or fintech companies probably covet. The Discover network alone would be worth up to $6 billion if sold to Alphabet,\nApple\nor Fiserv\n, Sakhrani wrote Tuesday in a research note.\nIt\u2019s a chess move by one of the savviest long-term thinkers in American finance, Capital One CEO Richard Fairbank. As a co-founder of a top 10 U.S. bank by assets, his tenure is a rarity in a banking world dominated by institutions like JPMorgan Chase\nthat trace their origins to shortly after the signing of the Declaration of Independence.\nFrom the time of Capital One\u2019s founding in the late 1980s, Fairbank said, he envisioned creating a global digital payments tech company by owning the payment rails and dealing directly with merchants. In the decades since, Capital One has been ahead of stodgier banks, gaining a reputation in tech circles for being forward-thinking and for its early adoption of cloud computing and agile software development.\nBut it\u2019s Discover\u2019s payments network \u2014 the \u201crails\u201d that shuffle digital dollars between consumers and merchants, collecting tolls along the way \u2014 that Fairbank repeatedly praised Tuesday when analysts queried him on the strategic merits of the deal. There are only four major card networks: giants Visa\nand Mastercard\n, then American Express\nand finally the smallest of the group, Discover.\nProposed legislation from Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., aims to cap the fees charged by Visa and Mastercard, potentially blowing up the economics of credit card rewards programs. If that proposal becomes law, the competitive position of Discover\u2019s network, which is exempt from the limitations, suddenly improves, according to Brian Graham, co-founder of advisory firm Klaros Group. That mirrors what an earlier law known as the Durbin amendment did for debit cards.\n\u201cWhich thing you are more concerned about will define whether you think this is a good deal or a bad deal from a public policy point of view,\u201d Graham said.\nFairbank, who became a billionaire by building Capital One into a credit card giant since its 1994 IPO, is betting that buying rival card company Discover will better position the company for global payments\u2019 murky future. The industry is a dynamic web where players of all stripes \u2014 from traditional banks to fintech players and tech giants \u2014 are all seeking to stake out a corner in a market worth trillions of dollars by eating into incumbents\u2019 share amid the rapid growth of e-commerce and digital payments.\n\u00a9 2024 CNBC LLC.

It does so indirectly by measuring insurers\u2019 profits. This is because insurance quality varies greatly from person to person. One person\u2019s premiums may buy high-value insurance benefits, while another\u2019s buys meager coverage.\nServices businesses are more sensitive to labor costs, economists said.\nFalling energy prices have also put downward pressure on goods prices, due to lower transportation and energy-intensive manufacturing costs, economists said. Overall energy costs have fallen by 4.6% in the past year.\nSo-called \u201ccore\u201d goods inflation \u2014 which exclude food and energy prices, which can be volatile \u2014 was negative 0.3% in January 2024 relative to a year earlier, according to the latest consumer price index data issued Tuesday by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nThe Nominal Broad U.S. Dollar Index is higher than at any pre-pandemic point dating to at least 2006, according to U.S. Federal Reserve data.

That\u2019s due to factors such as lower jet fuel costs for airlines and an increase in seat capacity (available seat supply for passengers due to greater flight volume) on domestic and international flights, according to Hopper.\nAverage prices have deflated for these physical goods, among others, from January 2023 to January 2024: furniture and bedding (prices have fallen by 2.9%); major household appliances (-7.3%); men\u2019s suits, sport coats and outerwear (-5.3%); girls\u2019 apparel (-9%); video and audio products (-5.8%); sporting goods (-1.1%); toys (-4.2%); and college textbooks (-5.7%), according to CPI data.\nA hot job market as the economy reopened in 2021 led workers\u2019 wage growth to balloon to its highest in decades. Average earnings have cooled along with the broader labor market but remain elevated relative to their pre-pandemic baseline, they said.\nIn addition to normalizing supply-demand dynamics, a historically strong U.S. dollar relative to other global currencies has also helped rein in goods prices, Zandi said. This makes it cheaper for U.S. companies to import goods from overseas, since the dollar can buy more.\nDeflation has largely occurred among physical goods rather than services, economists said.

In fact, some categories have fallen into outright deflation, meaning consumers are seeing the prices decline instead of rise.\nThese sorts of quality adjustments mean consumers don\u2019t necessarily see prices drop at the store, just on paper.\nAmong grocery items, egg and lettuce prices declined significantly from January 2023 to January 2024 (by 28.6% and 11.7%, respectively) after having soared in 2022. Among the reasons for those initial shocks: a historic outbreak of avian influenza in the U.S., which is extremely lethal among chickens and other birds, and an insect-borne virus that raged through the Salinas Valley growing region in California, which accounts for about half of U.S. lettuce production.\nThe services sector of the U.S. economy has seen disinflation \u2014 which is when prices are still rising but at a slower pace than they had been \u2014 but hasn\u2019t sunk into deflation like core goods. Services inflation (minus energy) is still up 5.4% since January 2023, according to CPI data.\nHealth insurance, which falls in the services side of the U.S. economy, is similar.\nData also provided by\nPrices for used cars and trucks have also deflated over the past year, by 3.5%, according to CPI data.\nHealth insurance prices declined by 23.3% over the past year. That decline reflects smaller insurer profits in 2021 relative to 2020.\nFor example, in the CPI data, the Bureau of Labor Statistics controls for quality improvements over time.

Factoring in that many victims don\u2019t report their losses to anyone, the overall losses could be in the tens of billions of dollars annually, they say.\nThe banking industry is seeking help from the federal government and the social media industry to stop an escalating crisis that\u2019s costing Americans billions of dollars every year: online romance scams.\n\u201cWe\u2019re legally obligated to provide you access to your funds, full stop. So we can\u2019t stop you from withdrawing from your bank account. Not even if we think that ... it\u2019s going to destroy your life,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard stories where we know a bank teller that was sobbing ... talking with a longtime customer, begging them not to do this type of thing, and in the end, no, we have to give them access to their funds,\u201d Benda said.\nOnce that psychological hook is set, the scammer turns the conversations to money. In some cases, they present the victim with a sure-fire-seeming investment opportunity, or they prey on the victim\u2019s empathy and solicit money for an expensive but phony medical procedure.\nThe experience can be an emotional one even for the bank employees who watch the scam play out.\nScammers will often coach the victim on how to access and transfer funds. And Benda noted banks are in a difficult position, even when they suspect their customer is in the process of being defrauded.\n\u201cThat\u2019s an astonishing number. It\u2019s huge,\u201d she said, adding the caveat that arriving at an estimate can involve some guesswork since victims can be reluctant to report the details of their own financial humiliation.\nThey also saw the value in regulatory changes that would allow financial institutions to talk to one other about customers who are at risk. Some victims may be draining a savings account with one institution to send funds to a fraudster, while the institution that services their 401(k) retirement account remains unaware.\nBanks generally will not reimburse a customer for romance scam losses, Benda explained, because the customer transferred the money of their own free will. And reimbursing victims would likely just make a market that would draw in more scammers.\n\u201cAnd then they provide a dream that not only can you be loved, but you can be financially comfortable beyond your wildest dreams,\u201d West said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to call it lust and greed, but what it really is, is it\u2019s comfort on both levels.\u201d\nThe romance scams are run by organized criminal gangs, often based in Southeast Asia, that set up phony social media avatars and use those to connect to potential American victims.

Goods production couldn\u2019t keep up with high demand amid snarled supply chains.\nNow, supply chains and consumer demand for goods have largely normalized, Bryson said.\nInflation in the \u201cservices\u201d side of the economy \u2014 the intangible things we consume, such as concerts, auto repairs and veterinary visits \u2014 is also declining but remains elevated, he said. A big reason for this is wage growth, since labor is a major input cost for services businesses, economists said.\nInflation for groceries, for example, has declined to 1.2% over the last 12 months, from a peak of around 13.5% in August 2022. Some categories \u2014 such as frozen noncarbonated juices and drinks, sugar, and beefsteaks \u2014 remain elevated, though. Their prices are up by 29%, 7.2% and 10.7%, respectively.\nSugar prices, for example, were affected by \u201congoing shortfalls and availability issues\u201d in 2023, said Amy Smith, an economist at Advanced Economic Solutions.\nEconomists expect housing inflation to moderate due to encouraging signals, such as moderating national prices for newly signed leases, a trend that tends to take months to flow into broader inflation data.\nIt was a \u201cdouble whammy\u201d that caused prices to \u201cskyrocket,\u201d according to Jay Bryson, chief economist for Wells Fargo Economics.\nInflation initially spiked in early 2021 as the U.S. economy reopened from its Covid-19-related shutdown.\n\u201cYou get zigs and zags in all these data, and this was just a zag,\u201d Zandi said. \u201cThe bottom line: Inflation continues to moderate.

And all the trend lines still look good aside from today\u2019s data detour.\u201d\nBusinesses\u2019 demand for workers rose to a record high as the economy reopened, and wage growth jumped to its highest level in decades as workers enjoyed ample leverage in the job market. That growth has since eased as the labor market has cooled from red-hot levels, reducing the inflationary pressure for services, but remains elevated, economists said.\nMeanwhile, overall energy costs have decreased, or deflated, by 4.6% in the past year, with gasoline down 6.4%, natural gas 17.8% and fuel oil 14.2%.\nSugar is a key ingredient in, among other things, juices and drinks; the latter were also affected by bad weather in Brazil and Florida, which reduced production of oranges and led futures on frozen concentrated orange juice to surge to an all-time high in November, Smith said. And beef production was down almost 5% in 2023, due partly to the impact of severe drought on pasture lands, she added.\nOther categories have retreated significantly.\nAdditionally, shelter inflation is up 6% in the last 12 months. Shelter is the largest component of the average household\u2019s budget, and stubbornly high inflation in the category has propped up overall inflation readings.\n\u201cEverything suggests that\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Zandi said. \u201cThe lag is longer than I would have anticipated.\u201d\nNormalizing inflation means consumers don\u2019t need to spend down their \u201cexcess savings\u201d to support spending, according to a recent outlook authored by J.P.

There are also few ways for workers to access 401(k) savings before retirement, such as loans or hardship withdrawals, which are also technically sources of leakage.\nBut job change is another access point, and one that concerns policymakers: At that point, workers can opt for a check (minus tax and penalties), among other options.\nA caveat: One of the six participating providers must be administering the worker\u2019s 401(k) plan at both their old and new employers for the transfer to work, meaning not all workers will be covered.

At around $35 per transaction at many banks, the fees have been a lucrative line item for the industry, generating $280 billion in revenue since 2000, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\nJPMorgan had $1.1 billion in overdraft revenue last year, about 12% lower than in 2022. Wells Fargo saw a 27% decline to $937 million. Bank of America posted a 64% decline to $140 million.\nThose who kept the fees, including JPMorgan, limited the types of transactions that trigger penalties, got rid of fees for bounced checks and introduced one-day grace periods and $50 cushions to reduce their frequency.\nMore than 70% of overdraft transactions no longer incur fees, and customers can choose accounts that don\u2019t allow the penalties, a JPMorgan spokesman told CNBC.\n\u201cWhether folks eliminated some fees or dramatically reduced the cost of others, there\u2019s been very significant shifts here,\u201d said Jennifer Tescher, CEO of nonprofit group Financial Health Network. \u201cBanks aren\u2019t just getting rid of overdraft, they\u2019re trying to find more customer-friendly ways of meeting their liquidity needs while making sure they aren\u2019t overextended.\u201d\nIndustrywide overdraft revenue totaled $7.7 billion in 2022, 35% below the 2019 level, according to a May CFPB report that included all U.S. banks with at least $1 billion in assets.\nThe three biggest American retail banks collected 25% less overdraft revenue last year as the companies, under pressure from regulators to cap the fees, created new ways for customers to avoid the penalties.\nBank of America cut the fees to $10 from $35 in 2022.\nWells Fargo declined to comment. A Bank of America spokesman noted that after the company voluntarily changed its overdraft policies in 2022, revenue from the practice fell more than 90%, and they now collect less than smaller banks.\nThe industry is girding itself for a battle over overdraft fees after the CFPB in January unveiled a proposal to limit charges to as little as $3 per transaction.

Additionally, she sees indications that firms which raised their prices frequently during the big inflation run-up of 2021-22 are doing so less now.\n\u201cWhile heartened by the progress to date, I will need to see more evidence before considering adjusting the policy stance,\u201d Collins said remarks for a speech to the Boston Economic Club. \u201cAs we gain more confidence in the economy achieving the Committee\u2019s goals, and consistent with the last set of projections from FOMC participants, I believe it will likely become appropriate to begin easing policy restraint later this year.\u201d\n\u201cAll of these metrics are very strong, and inflation is coming down.

As a co-founder of a top 10 U.S. bank by assets, his tenure is a rarity in a banking world dominated by institutions like JPMorgan Chase\nthat trace their origins to shortly after the signing of the Declaration of Independence.\n\u201cThat network is a very, very rare asset,\u201d Fairbank said. \u201cWe have always had a belief that the Holy Grail is to be able to be an issuer with one\u2019s own network so that one can deal directly with merchants.\u201d\nFrom the time of Capital One\u2019s founding in the late 1980s, Fairbank said, he envisioned creating a global digital payments tech company by owning the payment rails and dealing directly with merchants. In the decades since, Capital One has been ahead of stodgier banks, gaining a reputation in tech circles for being forward-thinking and for its early adoption of cloud computing and agile software development.\n\u201cThere are a bunch of things aimed, in one way or another, at the card networks and that ecosystem,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThose pressures might be one of the things that creates an opportunity for Capital One in the future if they have control over this network.\u201d\n\u201cThis deal gives the company a stronger hand to battle other banks, fintechs and big tech companies,\u201d said Sanjay Sakhrani, the veteran KBW retail finance analyst. \u201cThe more that they can separate themselves from the pack, the more they can future-proof themselves.\u201d\nCapital One\u2019s\nrecently announced $35.3 billion acquisition of Discover Financial\nisn\u2019t just about getting bigger \u2014 gaining \u201cscale\u201d in Wall Street-speak \u2014 it\u2019s a bid to protect itself against a rising tide of fintech and regulatory threats.\nBy 2027, the bank expects to add at least $175 billion in payments and 25 million of its cardholders onto the Discover network.\nThe true potential of the Discover deal, though, is what it allows Capital One to do in the future if it owns the toll road, according to analysts.\nDon\u2019t miss these stories from CNBC PRO:\nBut its growth has relied on Visa and Mastercard, which accounted for the vast majority of payment volumes last year, processing nearly $10 trillion in the U.S. between them.\n\u201cOwning a network allows us to deal more directly with merchants rather than a network intermediary,\u201d Fairbank told analysts. \u201cWe create more value for merchants, small businesses and consumers and capture the additional economics from vertical integration.\u201d\nData also provided by\nOn Tuesday, Democratic Sen.

While Fairbank said he expects the deal to be closed in late 2024 or early 2025, industry experts said it was impossible to know whether it will be blocked by regulators, like a string of high-profile takeovers among banks, airlines and tech companies.\nThe Discover deal\u2019s survival may hinge on whether it\u2019s seen as boosting an also-ran payments network, or allowing an already-dominant card lender to level up in size \u2014 another reason Fairbank may have played up the importance of the network.\nThe Capital One-Discover combination could fortify the company against another potential threat \u2014 from Washington.\n\u201cWhich thing you are more concerned about will define whether you think this is a good deal or a bad deal from a public policy point of view,\u201d Graham said.\nData is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutes.

Dick Durbin, D-Ill., aims to cap the fees charged by Visa and Mastercard, potentially blowing up the economics of credit card rewards programs. If that proposal becomes law, the competitive position of Discover\u2019s network, which is exempt from the limitations, suddenly improves, according to Brian Graham, co-founder of advisory firm Klaros Group. That mirrors what an earlier law known as the Durbin amendment did for debit cards.\nCapital One aims to deepen relationships with merchants by showing them how to boost sales, helping them prevent fraud and providing data insights, Fairbank said Tuesday, all of which makes them harder to dislodge.

Overall energy costs have fallen by 4.6% in the past year.\nInflation has pulled back significantly from its pandemic-era peak. In fact, some categories have fallen into outright deflation, meaning consumers are seeing the prices decline instead of rise.\nDeflation has largely occurred among physical goods rather than services, economists said. The former are tangible objects, while the latter are largely things we can experience, like haircuts and veterinary visits.\nThe average American allocates most of their budget \u2014 about two-thirds of it \u2014 to services instead of goods.\nFor example, in the CPI data, the Bureau of Labor Statistics controls for quality improvements over time. Electronics such as televisions, cellphones and computers continually get better. Consumers get more for roughly the same amount of money, which shows up as a price decline in the CPI data. \nSo-called \u201ccore\u201d goods inflation \u2014 which exclude food and energy prices, which can be volatile \u2014 was negative 0.3% in January 2024 relative to a year earlier, according to the latest consumer price index data issued Tuesday by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn\u2019t assess health insurance inflation based on consumer premiums. It does so indirectly by measuring insurers\u2019 profits. This is because insurance quality varies greatly from person to person. One person\u2019s premiums may buy high-value insurance benefits, while another\u2019s buys meager coverage.\nIn addition to normalizing supply-demand dynamics, a historically strong U.S. dollar relative to other global currencies has also helped rein in goods prices, Zandi said. This makes it cheaper for U.S. companies to import goods from overseas, since the dollar can buy more.\nData also provided by\nLower energy prices also put downward pressure on the transportation of food to store shelves.\nServices businesses are more sensitive to labor costs, economists said.\nAmong grocery items, egg and lettuce prices declined significantly from January 2023 to January 2024 (by 28.6% and 11.7%, respectively) after having soared in 2022. Among the reasons for those initial shocks: a historic outbreak of avian influenza in the U.S., which is extremely lethal among chickens and other birds, and an insect-borne virus that raged through the Salinas Valley growing region in California, which accounts for about half of U.S. lettuce production.\nNow, they\u2019re falling back to earth.\n\u201cThe most recent [Employment Cost Index] wage growth numbers for Q4 2023 came in below 4% annualized (first time since Q2 2021), which reflects the better balance between labor demand and supply that has been achieved by rebalancing,\u201d according to a recent outlook authored by J.P. Morgan\u2019s Global Investment Strategy Group.\nGot a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.\nDemand for goods soared early in the Covid-19 pandemic, as consumers were confined to their homes and couldn\u2019t spend on things such as travel or concerts. The health crisis also snarled global supply chains, meaning volume couldn\u2019t keep pace with demand for those goods. Such supply-and-demand dynamics drove up prices.\nThese sorts of quality adjustments mean consumers don\u2019t necessarily see prices drop at the store, just on paper.\nPrices for used cars and trucks have also deflated over the past year, by 3.5%, according to CPI data.\nSome services categories have deflated, though.\nHealth insurance prices declined by 23.3% over the past year. That decline reflects smaller insurer profits in 2021 relative to 2020.\nHowever, economists fear that attacks by Houthi militias on merchant vessels in the Red Sea \u2014 a major trade route \u2014 could cause shipping disruptions and a reversal of some goods deflation.\n\u201cA lot of factors have come together to push goods prices down,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics.\nThe services sector of the U.S. economy has seen disinflation \u2014 which is when prices are still rising but at a slower pace than they had been \u2014 but hasn\u2019t sunk into deflation like core goods.

The numbers reflect \u201ca notable slowing from 2022 that was widespread across both goods and services prices.\u201d\nHe noted again that lowering rates too quickly risks losing the battle against inflation and likely having to raise rates further, while waiting too long poses danger to economic growth.\nQuestioning largely centered around Powell\u2019s views on inflation and rates."}, {"title": "Stocks making the biggest moves premarket: Palantir, CrowdStrike, Foot Locker", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/06/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-pltr-crwd-fl.html", "date": "2024-03-06", "text": "\nGot a confidential news tip?

In 2014, a group organized under the name Texas Central launched the most recent attempt to connect Dallas to Houston with a bullet train that travels more than 200 miles per hour, shortening a three and a half hour drive to a 90-minute train ride.\n\n\u201cYou cannot do that in a car,\u201d said Andy Byford, senior vice president of high-speed rail programs at Amtrak. \u201cYou cannot do that if you fly, if you factor in going to the airport, going through security, getting back in from the airport at the other end.\u201d\n\nByford is the latest in a long line of U.S. policy experts to call for more high-speed rail connections in the U.S. In 2023, Amtrak revived hopes for the bullet train in the Texas Triangle, when it announced its intention to broaden its partnership with Texas Central.\n\nThe fast-growing region contains both the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex and Houston, two of the largest population centers in the country.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t build high-speed rail between Dallas and Houston, then you only have two options,\u201d said Congressman Seth Moulton, D-Mass., a former managing director at Texas Central. \u201cYou can either expand the airport or expand the highway. It\u2019s not going to decrease the travel time between those cities. It\u2019s still going to take at least three hours to get between Dallas and Houston\u201d\n\nLocal experts told CNBC that the swelling population of Texas drivers has taken a toll on roads in the area, leading to traffic congestion and safety issues.\n\n\u201cOur transportation system is just really trying to keep up with our population growth\u201d said Brianne Glover, senior research scientist at Texas A&M University\u2019s Transportation Institute. \u201cCommuters experience somewhere around 40 hours of delay each year.\u201c\n\nThe Texas Central project has been repeatedly delayed as its backers navigate various regulatory hurdles, including environmental reviews and disputes over property rights. In 2022, the Texas Supreme Court declared that Texas Central, a private entity, met the legal definition of a public interurban electric railway company, giving it the power of eminent domain.\n\n\u201cWhen I was notified by my nephew through an article about eminent domain, I was absolutely shocked,\u201d said Jody Berry, a Dallas-based farmer who has opposed the Texas Central initiative. The proposed alignment for the Texas high-speed rail project crosses Morney-Berry Farm, which Berry\u2019s family has cultivated for generations.\n\n\u201cFinding out that the high-speed rail could potentially go through our property has made it very difficult for me to sleep,\u201d Berry said.\nGet this delivered to your inbox, and more info about our products and services.\nGot a confidential news tip?

Similar high-speed rail projects around the world have faced substantial cost overruns in development, including Japan\u2019s Tokaido Shinkansen system. The route in Texas is designed to leverage N700 cars found on the Shinkansen system.\n\nThe Texas effort has received substantial support from firms in Japan and the U.S. government. In 2018, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation issued a $300 million loan to support the project. And in late 2023, Texas Central received a Corridor ID program grant to study the route\u2019s potential for partnership with Amtrak.\n\nWith a historic $66 billion commitment to passenger rail, the U.S. government under Biden appears to have its best bet in generations to build high-speed rail systems. But the project and other publicly subsidized ones, such as the California project connecting Los Angeles to San Francisco, remain uncertain. The California project\u2019s estimated cost skyrocketed from $33 billion to over $100 billion amid delays and pushback from rural landowners, according to the California High-Speed Rail Authority.\n\n\u201cThe Biden Administration\u2019s aspirations for high-speed rail fail to account for several realities, including lack of customer demand, economic viability, and impact on existing rail infrastructure,\u201d said Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas, in a November 2023 congressional hearing on intercity passenger rail systems.\n\nThe backers of Texas Central declined repeated requests from CNBC for a comment on the project\u2019s progress and expected completion date.\n\nWatch the video above to learn about the long effort to bring high-speed rail system to the Texas Triangle.\n\u00a9 2024 CNBC LLC.

While the AI-driven bull run meets the first two criteria, Montgomery Koning said the third appears to be lacking.\nUntil the bubble burst spectacularly in March 2000.\nThe sheer scale and narrow nature of the bull run have evoked some concern about a market bubble, and UBS\nstrategists on Wednesday drew comparisons with the late 1990s.\nYet the Fed\u2019s dovish pivot and resilient economic growth in recent months have enabled stock market breadth to improve, both in terms of sectors and geography, with both European and Japanese indexes hitting all-time highs over recent weeks.\n\u201cSure, this can change, but data today on electronics and info tech orders, capex intentions and actual capex doesn\u2019t at all suggest the capital deepening associated with a productivity boost,\u201d he said.\n\u00a9 2024 CNBC LLC.

The stock surged afterward on the news that it had successfully raised funding.\nThat cash infusion follows last year\u2019s acquisition of PacWest by Banc of California, which was anchored by $400 million from Warburg Pincus and Centerbridge Partners. A January merger between FirstSun Capital and HomeStreet also tapped $175 million from Wellington Management.\nSpeed and discretion are key to these deals, according to advisors to several recent transactions and external experts. While selling stock into public markets could theoretically be a cheaper source of capital, it\u2019s simply not available to most banks right now.\n\u201cPublic markets are too slow for this kind of capital raise,\u201d said Steven Kelly of the Yale Program on Financial Stability. \u201cThey\u2019re great if you are doing an IPO and you aren\u2019t in a sensitive environment.\u201d\nLed by $450 million from ex-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\u2019s Liberty Strategic Capital, a group of private investors are plowing fresh funds into NYCB.

DiNello will stay on as nonexecutive chairman at the bank, according to Wednesday\u2019s press release.\nMnuchin will be one of four new members of the bank\u2019s board of directors as part of the deal. Joseph Otting, former comptroller of the currency, is also joining the board and taking over as CEO.\nThe stock jumped sharply after the announcement, but trading was highly volatile. Shares were briefly halted, up nearly 30% for the day. They gave back some of those gains when trading resumed and finished the day up more than 7% after several more halts.\nWith the U.S. economy continuing to show surprising strength and inflation still above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target, traders have been dialing back expectations for interest rate cuts this year. The higher-for-longer rate environment could keep pressure on the banks themselves and on commercial real estate, which is a key business for NYCB and many other regional lenders.\nThe cash infusion is the latest development in a turbulent start to the year for NYCB. The bank disclosed in late January that it was dramatically raising the allowance for potential loan losses on its balance sheet, with its exposure to commercial real estate being a potential issue. That was followed shortly by Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgrading the bank\u2019s credit rating to junk status, and NYCB naming former Flagstar bank CEO Alessandro DiNello as executive chairman.\nNYCB has agreed to a deal with several investment firms including Mnuchin\u2019s Liberty Strategic Capital, Hudson Bay Capital and Reverence Capital Partners for more than $1 billion in exchange for equity in the regional bank, according to a press release Wednesday afternoon.\nPrior to the press release, the stock was down 42%, amid reports from Reuters and The Wall Street Journal that NYCB was exploring a capital raise.\nThe questions surrounding NYCB are reminiscent of those that swirled around Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic before all three failed in the spring of 2023. They were among several regional banks that struggled as higher interest rates pushed down the value of older Treasury holdings and led some depositors to move their accounts elsewhere.\nThe struggles for NYCB may have caught regulators off guard as well as investors. The regional lender acquired much of Signature Bank out of receivership from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation last March.\n\nDon\u2019t miss these stories from CNBC PRO:\n\u00a9 2024 CNBC LLC.

Those who do have retirement savings are less likely to have $100,000 or more (22% vs. 30%).\nFor example, if women think they\u2019re underpaid, they can sit down with their managers at work, inquire about opportunities for growth and find avenues for higher earning potential, Collado said. Show managers where you add value and try to get fair compensation, she added.\nThat may be easier to do in certain states due to growth in pay transparency laws, which require that employers disclose a salary range for job listings.\nCompounding the problem: Caregiving, especially for a spouse, has a \u201cmore detrimental economic impact\u201d on women, according to the National Institute on Retirement Security.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., no fan of Powell to start with, called in January for the Fed to start cutting as higher rates are especially painful for lower-income households.\nThe past several months have seen a changing dynamic between financial markets and the Fed over the pace and timing of expected interest rate cuts this year. Markets have had to adjust their collective view from a highly accommodative central bank to one that\u2019s more cautious and deliberate.\nGot a confidential news tip?

But if there is any change, any nuance, that is what the market wants to see.\u201d\nInflation readings in the latter part of 2023 showed a clear trend toward the Fed\u2019s 2% target. However, January brought a jolt, showing that consumer prices, particularly in shelter costs, remained stubbornly higher and posed a threat to the trend.\nCentral to the question of how the Fed acts from here on out is its view on inflation and how Powell expresses that. In recent weeks, he and others have expressed satisfaction with the trend in prices along with apprehension that risks still lurk, saying it\u2019s too early to ease up on monetary policy.\nBoth conditions are concerning for policymakers. Big jumps in risk asset prices could reflect loose financial conditions that might cause the Fed to hold tight on policy, while a less certain environment could raise fears about staying too high for too long on rates.\n\u201cThe message very much is not going to be \u2018mission accomplished,\u2019 but \u2018we\u2019ve made a lot of progress, we anticipate rate cuts are coming,\u2019\u201d said Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities. \u201cThat to me is what I think will be the central message.\u201d\nData is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutes.

As a result, hundreds of billions of dollars of unrealized losses on low-interest bonds and loans remain buried on banks\u2019 balance sheets. That, combined with potential losses on commercial real estate, leaves swaths of the industry vulnerable.\nBut deals have been few and far between. There were fewer than 100 bank acquisitions announced last year, according to advisory firm Mercer Capital. The total deal value of $4.6 billion was the lowest since 1990, it found.\nBehind the scenes, regulators have been prodding banks with confidential orders to improve capital levels and staffing, according to Klaros co-founder Brian Graham.\nThere are other signs of mounting stress among smaller banks. In 2023, 67 lenders had low levels of liquidity \u2014 meaning the cash or securities that can be quickly sold when needed \u2014 up from nine institutions in 2021, Fitch analysts said in a recent report.

A third of regional bank CEOs are older than 65, beyond the group\u2019s average retirement age, according to 2023 data from executive search firm Spencer Stuart. That could lead to a wave of departures in coming years, the firm said.\nAnd regulators have added more companies to their \u201cProblem Bank List\u201d of companies with the worst financial or operational ratings in the past year.

That strategy also puts them at risk of being swamped by rising loan losses.\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged this month that commercial real estate losses are likely to capsize some small and medium-sized banks.\nThese banks need to either raise capital, likely from private equity sources as NYCB did, or merge with stronger banks, Graham said. That\u2019s what PacWest resorted to last year; the California lender was acquired by a smaller rival after it lost deposits in the March tumult.\nMost of the banks deemed to be potentially challenged are community lenders with less than $10 billion in assets.

Starting early in one\u2019s career benefits the investor due to a longer time horizon for interest and investment returns to compound.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be a rocket scientist. Investing is not a game where the guy with the 160 IQ beats the guy with 130 IQ,\u201d Warren Buffett, chair and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, famously said.\nWhile appropriate long-term goals may differ from person to person, one rule of thumb is to save roughly 1x your salary by age 30, 3x by 40 and ultimately 10x by 67, according to Fidelity Investments.\n\u201cI think sometimes novice investors question the simple elegance of some of these very solid choices,\u201d Benz said. \u201cPeople crave something more complex because they assume it has to be better, but it\u2019s not.\u201d\nBenz recommends selecting a TDF that uses underlying index funds.

Because TDFs regularly rebalance, there are likely to be transactions within the fund that trigger capital-gains taxes if not held in a tax-advantaged retirement account.\n\u201cWhere else do you get 100% on your money?\u201d she said.\nInvestors need only choose their TDF provider, their target year and how much to invest.\nInvesting can seem overly complicated, and that complexity may paralyze Americans into doing nothing.\nInvestors who want to be a bit more hands-on relative to TDF investors have other simple options, experts said.\nTDFs are a good starting point for \u201cdo nothing\u201d investors who seek a hands-off approach, said Lee Baker, a certified financial planner and founder of Apex Financial Services in Atlanta.\nYoung, long-term investors should generally ensure their fund \u2014 whether TDF or otherwise \u2014 has a high allocation to stocks, around 90% or more, said McClanahan, a member of CNBC\u2019s Advisor Council.\nGet this delivered to your inbox, and more info about our products and services.\nData is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutes.

A 2024 poll by Patriotic Millionaires found that more than half (58%) of millionaires from G20 countries back a 2% tax on wealth over $10 million. Three-quarters (74%) said they support higher taxes on the wealthy in general.\nOutlining his 2025 budget proposals on Monday, Biden took aim at the uber-affluent and reiterated plans for a 25% tax on Americans with a wealth of more than $100 million.\nGlobal wealth inequality has risen significantly over recent years, with the richest 1% bagging two-thirds of all new wealth created since 2020, according to Oxfam. The poorest 50% of the global population now own just 2% of total net wealth, while the richest 10% hold 76%. Of that, the wealthiest 1% own around two-thirds.\nResearchers are divided on the risks of capital flight from a wealth tax, with some contending that cash outflows would be limited. But they do raise other concerns over the costs of such a policy and its ability to redistribute wealth. \nTax specialists note, however, that even well-designed wealth tax policies can be hard to enforce in practice, with questions arising over which assets should be taxed and who should be responsible for evaluating their value.  \nGot a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.\nCalls for a wealth tax on the world\u2019s super-rich are once again gaining attention after U.S. President Joe Biden said he would impose a new \u201cbillionaire tax\u201d on the country\u2019s wealthiest if reelected in November.\nA wealth tax is a \u201cbroad-based\u201d tax on the value of all \u2014 or most \u2014 of the assets belonging to a wealthy individual or household, such as cash, property, vehicles, jewelry and other valuable items.\n\u201cThere are people who are talking you know, very seriously about the idea of libertarianism and saying there is a limit on total wealth that people should be allowed to have and sort of basically 100% tax above that level,\u201d Advani said.\nStill, proponents argue that the revenues generated from a wealth tax could mark a major step in combatting the wealth gap.\nEven a 2% tax on the world\u2019s 2,756 known billionaires could raise $250 billion per year, according to a 2023 report from the independent research lab EU Tax Observatory, which backs calls for a global wealth tax. A separate Oxfam report in 2023 suggested a 5% tax on the world\u2019s multimillionaires and billionaires could raise $1.7 trillion annually \u2014 enough to lift 2 billion people out of poverty.\n\u201cThis is about the wealthy contributing more to the society, the extremely wealthy contributing more and being proud to do that,\u201d Phil White, retired business owner and Patriotic Millionaires co-signatory, told CNBC.\nAs of 2024, Switzerland, Norway, Spain and are among the few countries to impose some form of wealth tax. But more countries are coming around to the idea. Colombia introduced a wealth tax in 2022, and the Scottish government is among others to have touted proposals.\nData suggests that a wealth tax accounts for only a very small proportion of total tax revenues in the countries where it has been applied. Often those revenues have failed to increase much over time.\nSign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox\n\u00a9 2024 CNBC LLC. All Rights Reserved. \nA Division of NBCUniversal\nAccording to Arun Advani, associate professor of economics at the University of Warwick, the most effective wealth tax policies are those that are targeted and specific.\n\u201cThere is more cost on the tax authority side, because they\u2019ll definitely need to be doing additional valuations,\u201d Advani said. \u201cA different area of cost that you could be worried about is what does it do to, for example, incentives to invest.\u201d\nUnder Biden\u2019s proposals, a 25% tax on those with more than $100 million would raise $500 billion over 10 years to help fund benefits such as child care and paid parental leave. That would lift the average tax rate for America\u2019s 1,000 billionaires from 8.2% and bring it in line with the 25% paid by average American workers, according to Biden.\nIndeed, the potential for behavioral shifts is one of the top arguments leveled against wealth taxes. Critics point to the increased risk of a wealth exodus among the highly mobile super-rich, including to tax havens, which they say undermines original efforts to boost government coffers. \n\u201cWe certainly see individuals looking at other countries to see is, is if there was a wealth tax to be introduced would there be merit in moving?\u201d said Christine Cairns, personal tax partner at PwC.\nBut experts are divided over the effectiveness of a wealth tax, and how achievable it is in reality.\n\u201cNo billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a teacher, a sanitation worker, a nurse,\u201d he said last week, during his State of the Union address.\n\u201cIf you want a wealth tax that\u2019s actually going to be effective at the top end ... you typically want to start at quite a high threshold,\u201d Advani said, noting that historically abandoned policies either came in too low or allowed too many exemptions to generate sufficient tax revenues.\nGet this delivered to your inbox, and more info about our products and services.\nHowever, some question whether such calls could be a way for the world\u2019s richest to safeguard against a more radical redistribution of wealth in the future.\nData is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutes.

Entrepreneur Tord Kolstad was one of approximately 70 super-wealthy Norwegians who made the move in 2023.\n\u201cThey doubled this taxation from one day to another. This is the reason Norwegian business owners are forced to leave the country.

Kolstad Eiendom, said.\nData also provided by\nSuch ideas even have the backing of some of the world\u2019s wealthiest. In early 2024, a growing network of so-called Patriotic Millionaires signed an open letter to world leaders, calling for higher taxes for the wealthy.

And it\u2019s the second update in a week to Anthropic\u2019s capital structure. Late Friday, bankruptcy filings showed crypto exchange FTX struck a deal with a group of buyers to sell the majority of its stake in Anthropic, confirming a CNBC report from last week.\nAI and machine-learning investments from those seven tech companies jumped to $24.6 billion last year, up from $4.4 billion in 2022, according to Pitchbook. At the same time, Big Tech\u2019s M&A deals fell from 40 deals in 2022 to 13 last year. \n\u201cThere is a sort of paranoia motivation to invest in potential disruptors,\u201d Pitchbook AI analyst Brendan Burke said in an interview. \u201cThe other motivation is to increase sales, and to invest in companies that are likely to use the other company\u2019s product \u2014 they tend to be partners, more so than competitors.\u201d\nThe term generative AI entered the mainstream and business vernacular seemingly overnight, and the field has exploded over the past year, with a record $29.1 billion invested across nearly 700 deals in 2023, according to PitchBook. OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT first showcased the tech\u2019s ability to produce human-like language and creative content in late 2022. Since then, OpenAI has said more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies have adopted the platform, spanning industries such as financial services, legal applications and education.\nIt\u2019s a symbiotic relationship. As part of the agreement, Anthropic said it will use AWS as its primary cloud provider. It will also use Amazon chips to train, build and deploy its foundation models. Amazon has been designing its own chips that may eventually compete with Nvidia\n. \nThe U.S. Federal Trade Commission is taking a closer look at these partnerships, including Microsoft\u2019s OpenAI deal and Google and Amazon\u2019s Anthropic investments.

Of course there are going to be places where the model still makes something up from time to time.\u201d\nNews of the Amazon investment comes weeks after Anthropic debuted Claude 3, its newest suite of AI models that it says are its fastest and most powerful yet. The company said the most capable of its new models outperformed OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 and Google\n\u2019s Gemini Ultra on industry benchmark tests, such as undergraduate level knowledge, graduate level reasoning and basic mathematics.\nGot a confidential news tip?

It agreed to invest up to $2 billion in Anthropic, comprising a $500 million cash infusion, with another $1.5 billion to be invested over time. Salesforce is also a backer.\nBig Tech\u2019s spending spree in AI has come under fire for the seemingly circular nature of these agreements. By investing in AI startups, some observers, including Benchmark\u2019s Bill Gurley, have accused the tech giants of funneling cash back to their cloud businesses, which in turn, may show up as revenue.

Couples can also consider a prenuptial agreement or postnuptial agreement that contains provisions to protect a woman financially if she leaves the workforce to care for their children, for example, Colley said.\nThe sequence of claiming benefits can be important for married couples and can help women hedge against divorce (or widowhood) later, Colley said.\nBe strategic about claiming Social Security. Social Security is an important source of guaranteed income in retirement, especially for women.\nWomen shouldn\u2019t get to a point where they\u2019re unaware of their household\u2019s spending, savings, and mortgage payments and interest rates, for example, she said. Such information could come as a surprise upon divorce, and women may learn they\u2019re not financially well-protected.\nThe rate of \u201cgray divorce\u201d \u2014 a term that describes divorce at age 50 and older \u2014 doubled from 1990 to 2019, according to a 2022 study published in The Journals of Gerontology. It tripled for adults over age 65.\nWomen also tend to earn lower incomes than men due to a persistent wage gap; they tend to have less savings, and near-retirees who are divorcing don\u2019t have much time to make up the difference. Divorced women can claim a Social Security benefit based on their own earnings or a former spouse\u2019s earnings history, but the latter option is generally worth only up to half of an ex\u2019s benefit.\nFor example, let\u2019s say a husband is eligible for a larger Social Security benefit relative to his female spouse. He can defer claiming benefits to age 70, thereby maximizing his lifetime monthly benefit.\nData also provided by\nRetirement savers generally need earned income to open and contribute to an individual retirement account; however, women who don\u2019t work can open a \u201cspousal IRA\u201d based on their spouse\u2019s income. (You must be married and file a joint tax return to open one.)\nSave some alimony. If a woman receives alimony after a divorce, she should aim to save some of it, instead of spending it all, Elliott said. That\u2019s because alimony generally only lasts for a certain period \u2014 and women must make it last, she said.\nStudies suggest women\u2019s household income generally drops between 23% and 40% in the year after a divorce.\nHave access to your own money. Many couples commingle their financial accounts. Many women may also be authorized users of credit cards instead of primary owners, Elliott said.\nThat increases the monthly benefit his wife could receive upon divorce or widowhood, and helps maximize a woman\u2019s cash flow in such circumstances, Colley said.\nThese negative economic outcomes persisted over time, \u201cindicating that gray divorce operates as a chronic economic strain,\u201d they said.\nHere are some steps women can take to protect against the financial pitfalls of a potential future divorce, according to financial advisors.\nAdditionally, women should consider investing or saving in their own retirement account, she added.\n\u201cJust because you get alimony, it\u2019s not business as usual\u201d relative to spending levels, she said. \u201cYou probably need to reassess your lifestyle.\u201d\nGot a confidential news tip?

Many older adults who divorce today adhered to the traditional notion of a man as a household\u2019s sole breadwinner, they said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing women in divorce today who are of the generation where they just didn\u2019t work their entire life,\u201d said Natalie Colley, a CFP based in New York and senior lead advisor at Francis Financial.\nSign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox\nGet active in your household finances. \u201cWomen should take a very active role in their household finances,\u201d said Elliott, a member of CNBC\u2019s Advisor Council.\nBut women should ensure they have access to their own funds so their spouse can\u2019t shut off the financial spigot if a relationship sours, Elliott said.\nMeanwhile, rates of divorce have declined among younger adults, according to Susan Brown and I-Fen Lin, sociology professors at Bowling Green State University who authored the analysis.\nHere\u2019s a look at more coverage in CNBC\u2019s Women & Wealth special report, where we explore ways women can increase income, save and make the most of opportunities.\nDoing so generally permanently dents the caregiver\u2019s earning power, and a legal agreement can help insulate against that financial risk, she added. For example, perhaps it stipulates the woman gets a guaranteed stream of income for a certain number of years if the marriage dissolves, Colley said. She recommends working with an attorney who specializes in such legal documents.\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve met couples where the woman had no idea what the husband was doing financially,\u201d Elliott said.\n\u00a9 2024 CNBC LLC.

For example, there is a bitter legal fight brewing over the recent enactment of regulations requiring companies to disclose climate risks. Many contend this was not part of the original SEC mandate. The SEC disagrees, arguing it is part of the mandate to \u201cprotect investors.\u201d\nAdditionally, companies are provided with a \u201csafe harbor\u201d protection when they make forward-looking statements, which provide them with protection against certain legal liabilities. However, IPOs are not afforded this \u201csafe harbor\u201d protection, which is why forward-looking statements in an IPO registration are usually very cautiously worded.\nSign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox\nGot a confidential news tip?

It also required everyone involved in the securities business (mainly brokerage firms and stock exchanges) to register with the SEC.\nThere\u2019s also a division of examinations that conducts the SEC\u2019s National Exam Program. It\u2019s just what it sounds like. The SEC identifies areas of high concern (cybersecurity, crypto, money laundering, climate change, etc.) and then monitors Corporate America (investment advisers, investment companies, broker-dealers, etc.) to make sure they are in compliance with all the required disclosures. Current hot topics include climate change, crypto and cybersecurity.\nDisclosure. At the heart of the whole game is disclosure. That is the original requirement of the 1933 Act. The SEC has a division of corporation finance to make sure that Corporate America provides disclosures on issues that could materially affect companies. This starts with an initial public offering and continues when the company becomes publicly traded.\nRisk monitoring. To fulfill its mandate to protect investors, it\u2019s critical to understand what the risks to investors are. There is an economic and risk analysis division that does that.\nData also provided by\nThe 1933 Act did not make it illegal to sell a bad investment. It simply required disclosure: all relevant facts about an investment were supposed to be disclosed, and investors could make up their own minds."}, {"title": "Stocks making the biggest moves premarket: PVH, UnitedHealth, CVS Health", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/02/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-pvh-unh-cvs.html", "date": "2024-04-02", "text": "\nGet this delivered to your inbox, and more info about our products and services.\n\u00a9 2024 CNBC LLC.

I believe the odds are a lot lower than that.\u201d\nJPMorgan acquired most of the assets of First Republic last year for more than $10 billion after regulators seized the firm amid the regional banking crisis.\nIn his annual letter to shareholders released Monday, Dimon chose AI as the first topic in his update of issues facing the biggest U.S. bank by assets \u2014 ahead of geopolitical risks, recent acquisitions and regulatory matters.\nJamie Dimon, the veteran CEO and chairman of JPMorgan Chase\n, said he was convinced that artificial intelligence will have a profound impact on society.\nThe technology could ultimately touch all of the bank\u2019s roughly 310,000 employees, assisting some workers while replacing others, and forcing the company to retrain workers for new roles.\n\u201cWhile we do not know the full effect or the precise rate at which AI will change our business \u2014 or how it will affect society at large \u2014 we are completely convinced the consequences will be extraordinary,\u201d Dimon said.\n\u201cOver time, we anticipate that our use of AI has the potential to augment virtually every job, as well as impact our workforce composition,\u201d Dimon said. \u201cIt may reduce certain job categories or roles, but it may create others as well.\u201d\nJPMorgan now has more than 2,000 AI and machine learning employees and data scientists working on 400 applications including fraud detection, marketing and risk controls, Dimon said. The bank is also exploring the use of generative AI in software engineering, customer service and ways to boost employee productivity, he said.\n\u201cOne common sense and modest step would be for social media companies to further empower platform users\u2019 control over what they see and how it is presented, leveraging existing tools and features \u2014 like the alternative feed algorithm settings some offer today.

All of the following factors appear to be inflationary: ongoing fiscal spending, remilitarization of the world, restructuring of global trade, capital needs of the new green economy, and possibly higher energy costs in the future (even though there currently is an oversupply of gas and plentiful spare capacity in oil) due to a lack of needed investment in the energy infrastructure.\u201d\nData also provided by\nSign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox\nHere are excerpts from Dimon\u2019s letter:\nBut his focus on AI, first mentioned in Dimon\u2019s annual letter in 2017, stood out.

Enthusiasm for AI has fueled the meteoric rise of chipmaker Nvidia\nand helped propel tech names to new heights.  \n\u201cThe acquisition of a major company entails a lot of complexity. People tend to focus on the financial and economic outcomes, which is a reasonable thing to do. And in the case of First Republic, the numbers look rather good.

Instead of allowing [the] dollar to go wherever the market takes [it], and then these people who are not as fortunate as we are in the financial markets, end up suffering and end up voting for Mr. Trump,\u201d Koo added.\nKoo again pointed to past dealings with Japan, suggesting that if the argument held that overseas companies are just filling in where U.S. companies cannot satisfy domestic demand, then the American companies fighting Japanese firms in the 1970s and 70s should have recorded huge profits due to excess demand.\n\u201cThe dollar should have been much weaker, and Reagan understood that that\u2019s why he took that action.\u201d\nKoo nevertheless argued that this rests on the assumption that trade flows are balanced or in surplus, while the U.S. has been running huge deficits for the last forty years, which have expanded the number of \u201closers.\u201d\nHowever, rather than focus on imposing new tariffs, Biden has instead bet big on industrial policies such as the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act to bring manufacturers back to the United States, particularly in rapidly-growing sectors such as semiconductors and electric vehicles.\nFor Koo, the key problem was the exchange rate, as the strength of the U.S. dollar incentivized foreign imports and hurt U.S. companies exporting around the world.\n\u201cBut that did not actually happen. It\u2019s the opposite that happened. So many of them went bankrupt, so many losers of free trade were left in the streets, because it was not savings and investment issue, it was the exchange rate issue,\u201d he said.\nTrump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d economic policies led his administration to institute a slew of trade tariffs on China, Mexico, the European Union and others, including slapping 25% duties on imported steel and aluminum.\nGot a confidential news tip?

At the time, Reagan responded by facilitating the Plaza Accord with France, West Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom to depreciate the U.S. dollar against the respective currencies of these countries through intervention in the foreign exchange market.\nHe argued that economists need to move beyond the idea that the trade deficit is simply down to \u201ctoo much investment\u201d and \u201ctoo few savings\u201d in the U.S., as this means deficit can only be reduced by remaining in recession until domestic demand weakens so much that U.S. companies can export more goods, which would not be possible in a democracy.\nData also provided by\nSign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox\n\u201cBy 2016, the number of people who consider themselves losers of free trade, were large enough to elect Trump president, and so we have to really go back and say to ourselves: what did we do wrong to allow this many people in United States to view themselves as losers of free trade?\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe kind of let the exchange rate be decided by so-called market forces, speculators, my clients, Wall Street types, but the foreign exchange rate has to be set in a way that the number of losers does not grow to a point where the free trade itself is lost,\u201d Koo said."}, {"title": "China\u2019s Nio to expand battery swap services to gain an edge on EV infrastructure", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/05/chinas-nio-to-expand-battery-swap-services-to-gain-ev-infra-edge-.html", "date": "2024-04-05", "text": "\nBattery swapping still isn\u2019t mainstream because the car batteries need to be standardized, he added.\nNio said in mid-March that it completed 40 million battery swaps compared with nearly 37 million charges at its public stations \u2014 Nio consumers can also access third-party charging stations, or install one at home.\nShen said more car models will be added to Nio\u2019s battery swap network, while adding that swapping can allow drivers to keep abreast with improvements in battery technology. He did not specify which automakers will likely be added to its network.\nIn 2021, another startup, Ample, opened its battery swap stations in the San Francisco area \u2014 aimed at Uber drivers using the Nissan Leaf car.\n\u201cFor swapping to work it can\u2019t be niche,\u201d Tu Le, head of consultancy Sino Auto Insights, said. \u201cBattery inventory investment is massive, so it needs to be amortized over lots of swapping.\u201d\n\u201cI think the nudge the Chinese government gave to encourage others to join forces with Nio on swapping could create the necessary pool of vehicles to make swapping viable,\u201d he added.\nWhile a charging station resembles a typical gas station, battery-swap technology is housed in a shed-like structure.

General Motors announced a similar agreement last year.\nCLSA\u2019s analysis found that the power required for five superchargers in one location would be more than what 300 families would normally consume.\n\u201cI think our outlook is very simple,\u201d Shen Fei, senior vice president of Nio\u2019s power division, said in Chinese translated by CNBC. \u201cThe first thing is to serve Nio\u2019s users, and then provide a good battery charging and swapping experience, make charging more convenient than refueling, and at the same time help the company sell more cars.\u201d\n\u201cSwapping right now is mainly driven by Nio.

That\u2019s why they\u2019re thinking whether they can invite some partners.\u201d\nNio\u2019s investment in battery swap stations is about two years ahead of market demand, CEO William Li said last month, adding that less than a fifth of battery swap stations that Nio operates are processing 60 orders a day, likely the minimum orders needed for a station to break even.\n\u2014 CNBC\u2019s Lora Kolodny and Michael Wayland contributed to this report.\nBEIJING \u2014 Chinese electric car company Nio\nhas been expanding its battery swap partnerships in a bid to gain an edge on the infrastructure side of the EV ecosystem.\nTesla is also collaborating with automakers in battery charging, with its over 50,000 superchargers worldwide that claim to restore about two-thirds of a battery\u2019s charge in 15 minutes.\nCLSA\u2019s Luo said businesses also prefer to invest in normal charging stations than swap stations because they make a higher return. But if businesses want to install faster-charging stations, he said they might face power grid challenges.\nTesla and a startup called Better Space tried out swapping more than 10 years ago, but the venture soon closed.\nLast month, the company announced a partnership with battery giant Contemporary Amperex Technology\nto develop batteries with a longer lifespan, particularly for those used in swap stations.\nBattery swapping has been tried by the industry with mixed success, especially in the U.S.\nPower services and other products account for just about 10% of Nio\u2019s total revenue. The company said that category of \u201cother sales\u201d for 2023 grew by 69% to 6.36 billion yuan ($895.9 million). Nio does not break out swap station revenue.\nNio pointed out that recent growth of new energy vehicles, which include hybrids, means nearly 20 million batteries will be reaching the end of their eight-year warranty period between 2025 and 2032.\nAll these efforts are aimed at alleviating consumers\u2019 anxiety about driving range. While having a large network of battery charging stations helps address those concerns, battery swapping is a faster method as it takes only a few minutes.\nBut he was cautious on whether Nio could sell enough of its own premium-priced cars to make the economics work. \u201cFor now I still think the combination of swapping and charging makes for a pretty attractive feature set, but swapping alone likely doesn\u2019t help them sell that many more cars.\u201d\nGot a confidential news tip?

Finally, the division of trading and markets monitors everyone involved in trading: broker-dealers, stock exchanges, clearing agencies, etc. We can expect updates on record-keeping requirements, shortening the trading cycle (the U.S. goes to a one-day settlement from a three-day settlement on May 28, which is a big deal), and short sale disclosure.\nCongress then passed the Securities Act of 1933, and the following year passed the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which created the SEC to enforce all the new laws. It also required everyone involved in the securities business (mainly brokerage firms and stock exchanges) to register with the SEC.\nThe 1933 Act did not make it illegal to sell a bad investment. It simply required disclosure: all relevant facts about an investment were supposed to be disclosed, and investors could make up their own minds.\nThat sounds like a pretty broad mandate, and it is. Deliberately so. It came out of the disaster of the 1929 stock market crash, which was the initial event in the greatest economic catastrophe of the last 100 years: the Great Depression.\n\u00a9 2024 CNBC LLC. All Rights Reserved. \nA Division of NBCUniversal\nDisclosure. At the heart of the whole game is disclosure. That is the original requirement of the 1933 Act. The SEC has a division of corporation finance to make sure that Corporate America provides disclosures on issues that could materially affect companies. This starts with an initial public offering and continues when the company becomes publicly traded.\nData is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutes. Global Business and Financial News, Stock Quotes, and Market Data and Analysis.\nAdditionally, companies are provided with a \u201csafe harbor\u201d protection when they make forward-looking statements, which provide them with protection against certain legal liabilities. However, IPOs are not afforded this \u201csafe harbor\u201d protection, which is why forward-looking statements in an IPO registration are usually very cautiously worded.\nBased on Gensler\u2019s introductory remarks, there will be discussions about the upcoming move to shorten the securities settlement cycle from two days to one (T+1, which takes place May 28), the expansion of the definition of an exchange to include more recent trading platforms (like request-for-quote, or RFQ, electronic trading platforms), consideration of a change in the current one-penny increment for quoting stock trades to sub-penny levels, creation of a best execution standard for broker-dealers, and creation of more competition for individual investors orders (so-called payment for order flow).\nThe 1933 Act was the first major federal legislation to regulate the offer and sale of securities in the United States. This was followed by the Investment Company Act of 1940, which regulated mutual funds (and eventually ETFs), and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, which required investment advisers to register with the SEC.\nThe problem is that the definition of what should be disclosed has evolved over the decades. For example, there is a bitter legal fight brewing over the recent enactment of regulations requiring companies to disclose climate risks. Many contend this was not part of the original SEC mandate. The SEC disagrees, arguing it is part of the mandate to \u201cprotect investors.\u201d\nTuesday\u2019s conference is a chance for Gensler and his staff to tell everyone what they are doing in greater detail. The agency has six divisions, but they can be boiled down to disclosure, risk monitoring and enforcement.\nMutual funds, ETFs and investment advisers. We\u2019ll also hear from the division that monitor mutual funds and investment advisers. Most people invest in the markets through an investment advisor, and they usually buy mutual funds or ETFs. This is all governed by the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. There\u2019s a division of investment management that monitors all the investment companies (that includes mutual funds, money market funds, closed-end funds, and ETFs) and investment advisers. This division will be sharing insights on some of the new disclosure requirements that have been enacted in the past couple years, particularly rules adopted in August 2023 for advisers to private funds.\nRisk monitoring. To fulfill its mandate to protect investors, it\u2019s critical to understand what the risks to investors are. There is an economic and risk analysis division that does that.\nPrior to the recent rule changes, executives marketing a company to be acquired by a SPAC often made wild claims about the future profitability of these businesses \u2014 claims that would never have been possible to make had a traditional initial public offering route been used. The new SPAC rules that the SEC adopted made the target company legally liable for any statement made about future results by assuming responsibility for disclosures.\nThere\u2019s also a division of examinations that conducts the SEC\u2019s National Exam Program. It\u2019s just what it sounds like. The SEC identifies areas of high concern (cybersecurity, crypto, money laundering, climate change, etc.) and then monitors Corporate America (investment advisers, investment companies, broker-dealers, etc.) to make sure they are in compliance with all the required disclosures. Current hot topics include climate change, crypto and cybersecurity.\nLike I said, Trump will likely not come up at the conference, but the message: \u201cDisclosure!\u201d will likely be the dominant refrain.\nDonald Trump will likely not come up at the conference, but the SEC in January considerably tightened the rules around disclosure of special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs. Trump\u2019s company, Truth Social, went public on March 22 through a merger with a SPAC known as Digital World Acquisition Corp. It is now trading as Trump Media & Technology (DJT)\n, and it made disclosures Monday that caused the stock to drop about 22%.\nPrior to 1933, and particularly in the 1920s, all sorts of securities were sold to the public with wild claims behind them, much of which were fraudulent. After the crash of 1929, Congress went looking for a cause, and fraudulent claims and lack of disclosure were high on the list.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misspelled the name of the Practising Law Institute.\nSponsored by the Practising Law Institute, it is a forum where the SEC provides guidance to the legal community on rules, regulations, enforcement actions and lawsuits. The event allows the SEC to get its main messages across, and this year a key issue is \u201cdisclosure.\u201d\nThese are the cops. They conduct investigations into securities laws violations, and they prosecute the civil suits in the federal courts. This division will be providing an update on the litigation the SEC is involved in, which is growing.\nThe rules clarified that SPACs also do not have \u201csafe harbor\u201d legal protections for forward-looking statements, which means the companies could more easily be sued.\nYou often hear SEC officials say the role of the SEC is to \u201cprotect investors, maintain fair, orderly and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation.\u201d\nThe annual two-day \u201cSEC Speaks\u201d event kicked off Tuesday, offering clues to what the priorities will be for the Securities and Exchange Commission in the coming year.\nGot a confidential news tip?

But that\u2019s not the case with advance payments: Eligible buyers get their full value regardless of tax liability.\nAdvance payments are a new, optional financial mechanism created by the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed in 2022. They allow dealers to give an upfront discount to qualifying buyers, delivered as a partial EV payment, down payment or cash payment to consumers. The IRS then reimburses the dealer.\nThe bulk of Americans buying qualifying new electric vehicles are opting to receive an associated tax credit upfront from the car dealer instead of waiting until tax season, according to new Treasury Department data.  \n\u201cDemand is high four months into implementation of this new provision with American consumers saving more than half a billion dollars,\u201d Haris Talwar, a Treasury spokesperson, said in a written statement.\nAbout 90% of consumers who qualify for a \u201cnew clean vehicle\u201d tax credit \u2014 worth up to $7,500 \u2014 have requested their tax break be issued as an advance payment, according to a Treasury Department official speaking on background.\nNot everyone will necessarily qualify for the full $7,500, depending on factors like the type of car that\u2019s purchased.\nThe advance-payment provision kicked in Jan. 1.\nMore from Personal Finance:\n3 signs it\u2019s time to refinance your mortgage\nWhat Biden\u2019s new student loan forgiveness plan means for your taxes\nWhy the Fed is in no rush to cut interest rates in 2024\nGet this delivered to your inbox, and more info about our products and services.\nData also provided by\nThe Treasury has issued more than $580 million in advance payments since Jan. 1, the official said.\n\u201cIt means that it\u2019s popular,\u201d Ingrid Malmgren, policy director at nonprofit EV advocacy group Plug In America, said of the data.\nThere are 36 new EV models currently available for a tax break in 2024, according to U.S. Energy Department data as of March 18.\nCars and buyers must meet other requirements, too, which include income limits for households and thresholds on EV sticker prices.\nCar dealers have filed about 100,000 time-of-sale reports for new and used EVs to the IRS since Jan. 1, which signals that a consumer qualifies for a tax break, according to the Treasury official.\nBuyers need to sign an affidavit at car dealerships affirming their annual income doesn\u2019t exceed certain eligibility thresholds. Making an error would generally require consumers to repay the tax break to the IRS.\nOf course, there are some caveats to the advance payments. For one, not all car dealers are participating.\nData is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutes.

Some models qualify for half the tax credit \u2014 $3,750 \u2014 instead of the full $7,500.\nPreviously, all EV buyers had to wait until tax season the year after their purchase to claim related tax credits, meaning they may wait several months or longer.\nAdvance payments are also available for purchases of used EVs. The previously owned clean vehicle credit is worth up to $4,000.\nMore than 13,000 dealers have so far registered with the IRS Energy Credits Online portal to facilitate these financial transfers to consumers. That number is up from more than 11,000 in early February.\nThe advance payments can help with affordability, Malmgren said. For example, the upfront cash means households may not need to source funds from elsewhere to cover a down payment, she said. It can also reduce the cost of monthly car payments and overall interest charges, she added.\n\u00a9 2024 CNBC LLC. All Rights Reserved. \nA Division of NBCUniversal\nGot a confidential news tip?

Starting in the 1990s, Walmart made repeated efforts to enter the industry through direct ownership of a banking arm, each time getting blocked by lawmakers and industry groups concerned that a \u201cBank of Walmart\u201d would crush small lenders and squeeze big ones.\nThe startup has said that it makes decisions independent of Walmart, though its board includes Walmart U.S. CEO, John Furner, and its finance chief, John David Rainey.\n\u201cUpon information and belief, Walmart intends to offer its branded credit cards through One in the future,\u201d Capital One said last year in response to Walmart\u2019s suit. \u201cWith One, Walmart is positioning itself to compete directly with Capital One to provide credit and payment products to Walmart customers.\u201d\nData also provided by\nIn February, Walmart said it was buying TV maker Vizio for $2.3 billion to boost its advertising business, another growth area for the retailer.\nIn this article\nOne could generate roughly $1.6 billion in annual revenue from debit cards and lending in the near term, and more than $4 billion if it expands into investing and other areas, according to Morgan Stanley\n.\nAffirm declined to comment about its Walmart partnership.

The company declined to comment further.\nThose terms keep customers spending and saving within the Walmart ecosystem and helps the retailer better understand them, Morgan Stanley\nanalysts said in a 2022 research note.\nThe move puts One in direct competition with Affirm\n, the BNPL leader and exclusive provider of installment loans for Walmart customers since 2019. It\u2019s a relationship that the Bentonville, Arkansas, retailer expanded recently, introducing Affirm as a payment option at Walmart self-checkout kiosks.\nThe lawsuit led to speculation that Walmart intends to have One take over management of the retailer\u2019s co-branded and store cards. In fact, in legal filings Capital One itself alleged that Walmart\u2019s rationale was less about servicing complaints and more about moving transactions to a company it owns.\n\u201cWe see a lot of that customer demographic, so I think it gives us the ability to participate in this space in maybe a way that others don\u2019t,\u201d Rainey said. \u201cWe can digitize a lot of the services that we do physically today.

The U.S. Department of Energy approved the first application for New York on April 18, awarding it an initial $158 million.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act earmarked $369 billion in spending for policies to fight climate change, marking the biggest piece of climate legislation in U.S. history. President Biden signed the measure into law in August 2022.\nThis program pays up to $14,000 to consumers. It\u2019s only available to low- and moderate-income households, defined as being below 150% of an area\u2019s median income. (These geographical income thresholds are outlined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.)\nThe rebates aim to partially or fully offset costs for efficiency projects like installing electric heat pumps, insulation, electrical panels and Energy Star-rated appliances.\nTheir value and eligibility vary according to factors like household income, with more money flowing to low- and middle-income earners.\nHowever, consumers may be able to use the rebates in conjunction with existing programs available through states and local utilities, experts said. Consumers who want to make upgrades before these rebate programs are in place may be able to take advantage of other Inflation Reduction Act funding like tax breaks tied to home efficiency.\nThe DOE also expects the programs to save households $1 billion a year in energy costs due to higher efficiency, Zelmar said.\nWith Energy Department approval, states can opt to increase the maximum rebate to more than $8,000 for low earners.

States must develop and publish an approved contractor list as part of their program design.\nConsumers can\u2019t double dip, however. For example, a consumer who gets a rebate for buying an electric heat pump generally can\u2019t also apply the energy savings from that heat pump to the calculation for a whole household rebate, experts said.\nFor example, the program is worth up to $8,000 for households who cut energy use by at least 35%. It\u2019s worth a maximum $4,000 for those who reduce energy by at least 20%.\nData also provided by\nThe value of the rebates are tied to how much overall energy a household saves via efficiency upgrades. The deeper the energy cuts, the larger the rebates, Saul Rinaldi said.\nNew York\u2019s application was approved for the the latter program. So far, just four states \u2014 Georgia, Oregon, Indiana and New Mexico \u2014 have applied for both.\nRebates are also meant to be delivered at the point of sale. That may be at a retailer via an upfront discount on purchase price, or from a contractor who gives consumers a rebated amount off the project cost at the point of sale, Zelmar said.\nThe federal rebates \u2014 worth up to $14,000 or more per household, depending on a state\u2019s program design \u2014 are basically discounts for homeowners and landlords who make certain efficiency upgrades to their property.\n\u201cWe certainly hope to see all the programs launched ... by this time next year, and hopefully much sooner than that for many of the states,\u201d she said.\nRenters can also take advantage of the program, as long as they communicate to their landlord about the purchase of an appliance, Zelmar said.\nThe IRA divided $8.8 billion in total rebate funding between two programs: the Home Efficiency Rebates program and the Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates program.\nLow-income earners \u2014 those whose income is 80% or less of the area median \u2014 qualify for 100% of project costs.

Despite the resilient economy, higher rates for longer could threaten labor market stability, not to mention areas of the finance sector such as regional banks that are susceptible to duration risk posed to fixed income portfolios.\nWith most readings putting inflation around 3% and not moving appreciably for several months, the Fed finds itself in a tough slog on the last mile toward its goal.\nThe uncertainty has spread through the Street. The market-implied odds for no cuts this year stood around 11% on Wednesday, but the possibility can\u2019t be ignored at this point.\n\u00a9 2024 CNBC LLC.

Markets at the onset of 2024 had been pricing in at least six quarter-percentage point reductions.\nNow, Wall Street is wondering if the central bank will cut at all this year.\nMarket pricing for rate cuts has been highly volatile in recent weeks as Wall Street has chased fluctuating Fed rhetoric. As of Wednesday afternoon, traders were pricing in about a 71% probability that the central bank indeed most likely will wait until September, with the implied chance of a July cut at 44%, according to the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch gauge.\nA Fed policy mistake \u201cis the most significant risk to the economy at this point. They\u2019ve already achieved their mandate on full employment. They\u2019ve all but achieved their mandate on inflation,\u201d Zandi said.\nIf that is true, then \u201cthe pause on rate cuts would be lifted and the Fed would move ahead,\u201d wrote Krishna Guha, head of the global policy and central bank strategy team at Evercore ISI. However, Guha also noted the wide breadth of policy possibilities that Powell opened in his remarks Tuesday.\nGot a confidential news tip?

Powell and his fellow policymakers \u201cwill be pleasantly surprised\u201d by inflation data in coming months, wrote Citi economist Andrew Hollenhorst, who added that the Fed \u201cis poised to cut rates on either slower year-on-year core inflation or any signs of weakness in activity data.\u201d\nAs for a second rate cut, there was a tilt toward one in December, but that remains an open question.\nThat\u2019s because Powell on Tuesday said there\u2019s been \u201ca lack of further progress\u201d on lowering inflation back to the Fed\u2019s 2% target, meaning \u201cit\u2019s likely to take longer than expected\u201d to get enough confidence to start easing back on policy.\nTo be sure, there\u2019s still hope that the inflation data turns lower in the next few months and gives the central bank room to ease.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got the economy right where they want it. They now are just focused on inflation numbers. The question is, what\u2019s the bar here?\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cMy sense is they need two, probably three consecutive months of inflation numbers that are consistent with that 2% target. If that\u2019s the bar, the earliest they can get there is September. I just don\u2019t see rate cuts before that.\u201d\nElsewhere, Goldman Sachs pushed back the month that it expects policy to ease, but only to July from June, as \u201cthe broader disinflationary narrative remains intact,\u201d wrote Jan Hatzius, the firm\u2019s chief economist."}, {"title": "Stocks making the biggest moves midday: United Airlines, Travelers, Abbott Laboratories and more", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/17/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-midday-ual-trv-abt.html", "date": "2024-04-17", "text": "\nGot a confidential news tip?

The federal funds rate has been at that level since July 2023, when the Fed last hiked and took the range to its highest level in more than two decades.\nFed officials have shown near unanimity in their calls for patience on easing monetary policy as they look for confirmation that inflation is heading comfortably back to target. One or two officials even have mentioned the possibility of a rate increase should the data not cooperate.

The central bank\u2019s main gauge shows inflation running at a 2.7% annual rate \u2013 2.8% when excluding food and energy in the critical core measure that the Fed especially focuses on as a signal for longer-term trends.\nWith its decision to hold the line on rates, the committee in its post-meeting statement noted a \u201clack of further progress\u201d in getting inflation back down to its 2% target.\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The Federal Reserve on Wednesday held its ground on interest rates, again deciding not to cut as it continues a battle with inflation that has grown more difficult lately.\nQT was one way the Fed used to tighten conditions after inflation surged, as it backed away from its role of assuring the flow of liquidity through the financial system by buying and holding large amounts of Treasury and agency debt. The reduction of the balance sheet roll-off, then, can be seen as a slight easing measure.\nOn the balance sheet, the committee said that beginning in June it will slow the pace at which it is allowing maturing bond proceeds to roll off without reinvesting them.\nGet this delivered to your inbox, and more info about our products and services.\nMost recently, the Labor Department\u2019s employment cost index this week posted its biggest quarterly increase in a year, sending another jolt to financial markets.\nHowever, consumers have continued to spend, running up credit indebtedness and decreasing savings levels as stubbornly high prices eat away at household finances. Powell has repeatedly cited the pernicious effects of inflation, particularly for those at the lower-income levels.\nBeyond that, the statement was little changed, with economic growth characterized as moving at \u201ca solid pace,\u201d amid \u201cstrong\u201d job gains and \u201clow\u201d unemployment.\nConsequently, traders have had to reprice their expectations for rates in a dramatic fashion.

That would put the annual reduction in holdings at $300 billion, compared with $720 billion from when the program began in June 2022.

Documents provided to prosecutors and reviewed by NBC News identify instances at Square when it failed to conduct basic customer due diligence on its international merchant sellers and improperly reimbursed some of the merchants\u2019 funds that had been frozen for sanctions violations. (Merchants are considered customers at Square, while users are considered customers at Cash App.) New customers at both Square and Cash App who triggered sanctions alerts at their initial screenings were permitted to conduct transactions before the alerts were resolved, the documents say.

We want to hear from you.\nThe former employee also told prosecutors about the findings of an outside consultant Block hired to assess its internal systems for monitoring suspicious activities, rating customer risks and screening for sanctions violations. The consultant identified almost 50 deficiencies in those systems last year, the documents show. \nJames Booker, senior counsel at Sutton Bank, said in an email that the bank is working closely with regulators and that the recent consent order \u201csettled some longstanding issues concerning anti-money laundering controls\u201d that had arisen \u201cprior to the bank\u2019s 2023 restructuring of its anti-money laundering program.\u201d \nThe Southern District of New York did not respond to a request for comment about the inquiry.\nDuring his time on the board, Summers served on the audit committee, which is charged with reviewing and discussing with management the company\u2019s program and policies on risk assessment and risk management. The committee is overseen by Lord Paul Deighton, a former Goldman Sachs executive who was commercial secretary to the treasury in the U.K. government from 2013 to 2015. NBC News requested interviews with Deighton and Summers, but they declined, forwarding the requests to Block\u2019s corporate communications unit. \nIn its response to NBC News, the company said the hiring of the consultant showed Block\u2019s commitment to perform and improve compliance, adding that 50 deficiencies were not unusual given the report\u2019s scope. The former employee\u2019s interpretation of the report misconstrues its findings and their significance, the company said. \nAlong with senior management, the Block board of directors was informed of extensive lapses at the company, the former employee told prosecutors. In recent months, Block has announced the unexpected departures of two directors: Lawrence Summers, the former U.S. treasury secretary and a Block director since 2011, resigned in February, and in April it said Sharon Rothstein, a director since 2022, will not stand for re-election at the company\u2019s annual meeting in June.\nCash App is not a bank, but it uses external banking partners to conduct various services. One is Sutton Bank, the small Ohio institution that issues Cash App\u2019s prepaid Visa debit cards, allowing users to spend or withdraw their funds. Banks are required to know every one of their customers, but the Cash App program \u201chad no effective procedure to establish the identity of its customers,\u201d the previous whistleblowers said in their complaints to federal financial regulators.\nMobile payment apps like Cash App, PayPal and Venmo are popular, with over three-quarters of U.S. adults using them, according to a study last year by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. Known as person-to-person payment platforms, the services pose risks to their users and to the financial system, regulators say. In recent years, for example, law enforcement officials have cited criminals\u2019 use of payment apps to evade laws, such as laundering stolen Covid relief funds in 2020.\nThe company declined to answer questions about the specific deficiencies cited in the documents. It said that when deficiencies are identified, Block works \u201cwith our in-house legal team, as well as with outside counsel and consultants, to advise us on the issue and appropriate remediation.\u201d The company conducts recurring sanctions screening on all merchants, it said, and its program includes the essential components expected by OFAC.\nGet this delivered to your inbox, and more info about our products and services.\nBlock has encountered difficulties with regulators before.

By 2019, that figure had ballooned to more than 150 \u2014 an increase of well over 1,000%.\nThe financial threats of such climate disasters are numerous: property damage, higher insurance premiums and medical bills, lost earnings, falling real estate values, declining tourism, forgone business profits and displacement costs such as temporary housing or relocation, among others.\nThe financial impacts were broad. Among them, 34% couldn\u2019t commute to work, a dynamic that can reduce household earnings, experts said. \nThe financial burden of hurricanes falls hardest on lower-income households, according to researchers at the University of Pennsylvania. \nBut it\u2019s not as if officials can just move Southeast Florida, she added.\nNow, as a precaution, Williams covers his merchandise in plastic when it rains. \nSaltwater intrusion is being exacerbated by Miami\u2019s growth.\nBut it\u2019s not something that would push him to leave. \nMeanwhile, Miami Beach recently planted 680 mangroves in Brittany Bay Park, an effort to create a \u201cliving shoreline,\u201d said Amy Knowles, the municipality\u2019s chief resilience officer. \nDowntown Miami will soon host the tallest residential building south of New York City \u2014 the Waldorf Astoria Hotel and Residences, a 100-story monolith under construction on the shore of Biscayne Bay.

The Everglades, which replenishes local aquifers, has lost more than 70% of its water flow over the years, for example. Meanwhile, rising seas push salt water further inland.\nMiami\u2019s boom runs headlong into a harsh yet inescapable truth: It\u2019s \u201cground zero for climate change,\u201d said Sonia Brubaker, chief resilience officer for the City of Miami.\nFrom start to finish, Aria typically exits its real-estate projects after about five years, for example, said Arditi. It depends on the building \u2014 condominium projects may be on the short end of that range, while multifamily rentals are generally longer-term, he said.\n\u201cThis is the view everyone wants,\u201d he said from behind the wheel of a golf cart, as we rolled toward a thin shoreline outcropping of Bermuda grass in The Kampong, a botanical garden in Coconut Grove. A palm tree stood at its point and a sweeping vista of Biscayne Bay lay beyond.\nFlorida is also the hurricane capital of the country.\nAbout 70% of the 597 Miami-Dade County residents polled for a study published in the Climate Risk Management journal experienced rainfall-related flooding between 2017 and 2022, about 60% were affected by floodwater from hurricanes and tropical storms, and 16% were affected by tidal flooding. \nThe trend shows how many Americans are ultimately willing to overlook environmental risks, even though most acknowledge its presence \u2014 a choice that could later devastate them financially. \nSaltwater intrusion was \u201calmost certainly\u201d a contributing factor in the 2021 collapse of a condo building in nearby Surfside, Florida, that killed 98 people, he said. An investigation into the cause of the collapse is ongoing. \nSometimes, the flooding is so bad it\u2019s \u201calmost like a lake,\u201d Williams said. \n\u201cThe city actively plans for it,\u201d said Brubaker, who became the City of Miami\u2019s chief resilience officer in 2022. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of preparation going into this.\u201d\nIt is not that they deny climate change: More than three-quarters, 77%, of Miami-Dade County residents say global warming is happening, 5 percentage points above the 72% national average, according to a poll by Yale University\u2019s School of the Environment.\nIt projects that those values, which are adjusted for inflation, will rise to about $29 billion in 2024 and 2025.\nIn multiple street interviews CNBC conducted with Miami residents, weather was almost universally cited as the top draw.\nThese dynamics exacerbate flooding from rising seas, storm surge, torrential rains and so-called \u201cking tides,\u201d which are periodic exceptionally high tides. The frequency of flooding from high tides \u2014 known as \u201csunny day\u201d flooding \u2014 is up over 400% in Miami Beach since 2006.\nBaraloto estimates just 2% of mangroves are left in the peninsular City of Miami. \nResearchers at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development listed Miami as one of the 10 most vulnerable cities worldwide relative to the number of people at risk of coastal inundation. It\u2019s the most vulnerable when judged by the total value of assets such as buildings and infrastructure at risk.   \nAcross the U.S., people are still moving into areas increasingly prone to natural disasters, according to Andrew Rumbach, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard for residents, businesses, people to just kind of forget the beauty and the history and acknowledge the risk and maybe just leave,\u201d Knowles said.\nSign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox\nSuch company and worker relocations have helped boost the local economy, said Brubaker, the city official.\nDevelopers and city officials tell CNBC they think a booming city can continue to thrive alongside climate change.\nIndeed, the ultrarich have flocked to South Florida, driving a mansion boom. \nJuxtaposed at left was one of the last remaining patches of mangroves in the urban Miami area, a living memorial to a once-thriving population.

For example, a consumer who gets a rebate for buying an electric heat pump generally can\u2019t also apply the energy savings from that heat pump to the calculation for a whole household rebate, experts said.\nThe federal government is issuing $8.8 billion for Home Energy Rebates programs through states, territories and tribes, which must apply for the funding.

The deeper the energy cuts, the larger the rebates, Saul Rinaldi said.\nThis program pays up to $14,000 to consumers. It\u2019s only available to low- and moderate-income households, defined as being below 150% of an area\u2019s median income. (These geographical income thresholds are outlined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.)\nLow-income earners \u2014 those whose income is 80% or less of the area median \u2014 qualify for 100% of project costs. Others are limited to half of project costs. (Both are subject to the $14,000 cap.)\nThe rebates aim to partially or fully offset costs for efficiency projects like installing electric heat pumps, insulation, electrical panels and Energy Star-rated appliances.\nStates must notify the Energy Department they intend to participate by Aug. 16, 2024.

For the first time, Berkshire will broadcast its annual meeting movie that had previously always been reserved only for those in attendance in Omaha. Many speculate this year\u2019s will be a tear-jerker tribute to Munger.\nVice Chairman of Non-Insurance Operations Greg Abel, Buffett\u2019s designated successor, will fill Munger\u2019s seat in the afternoon session, helping answer shareholder questions. Vice Chairman of Insurance Operations Ajit Jain will join Buffett, the CEO, and Abel in the morning session. Buffett has said they expect to field about 40 to 60 questions Saturday.\nThe annual meeting comes at a tricky time for markets as a pickup in inflation puts the brakes on the Federal Reserve\u2019s plan to cut interest rates this year. While the Berkshire CEO doesn\u2019t make investment decisions based on daily headlines, investors still are eager to hear any market commentary and guidance from the protege of the father of value investing, Ben Graham.\nThe move came as a surprise to many because Apple has been Buffett\u2019s favorite stock for years, and he even called the tech giant his second-most important business after Berkshire\u2019s cluster of insurers.

The company\u2019s sales are roughly split between hybrid and battery-powered vehicles. BYD no longer sells traditional fuel-powered passenger cars.\nBattery manufacturer CATL\nhad a more prominent exhibition booth this year, likely in the hope of encouraging consumers to buy cars with its batteries, as competitors\u2019 market share grows, said Zhong Shi, an analyst with the China Automobile Dealers Association.\nThe initial version of the SUV is fuel-powered, for which the company\u2019s tagline is: \u201coil or electric, both are smart,\u201d according to a CNBC translation of the Chinese.\n\u201cThe difference today is that the overcapacity now has come together with vehicles that are very competitive,\u201d he told CNBC on the sidelines of the auto show. \u201cSo in our EV survey I was surprised to find that about 73% of U.S. consumers could recognize at least one Chinese EV brand.

One or two officials even have mentioned the possibility of a rate increase should the data not cooperate. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic was the first to specifically say he only expects one rate cut this year, likely in the fourth quarter.\nThe rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee did vote to ease the pace at which it is reducing bond holdings on the central bank\u2019s mammoth balance sheet, in what could be viewed as an incremental loosening of monetary policy.\nWith its decision to hold the line on rates, the committee in its post-meeting statement noted a \u201clack of further progress\u201d in getting inflation back down to its 2% target.\nQT was one way the Fed used to tighten conditions after inflation surged, as it backed away from its role of assuring the flow of liquidity through the financial system by buying and holding large amounts of Treasury and agency debt. The reduction of the balance sheet roll-off, then, can be seen as a slight easing measure.\nIn a program begun in June 2022 and nicknamed \u201cquantitative tightening,\u201d the Fed had been allowing up to $95 billion a month in proceeds from maturing Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities to roll off each month. The process has resulted in the central bank balance sheet to come down to about $7.4 trillion, or $1.5 trillion less than its peak around mid-2022.\nThe funds rate sets what banks charge each other for overnight lending but feeds into many other consumer debt products.

The central bank\u2019s main gauge shows inflation running at a 2.7% annual rate \u2013 2.8% when excluding food and energy in the critical core measure that the Fed especially focuses on as a signal for longer-term trends.\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The Federal Reserve on Wednesday held its ground on interest rates, again deciding not to cut as it continues a battle with inflation that has grown more difficult lately.\nHowever, consumers have continued to spend, running up credit indebtedness and decreasing savings levels as stubbornly high prices eat away at household finances. Powell has repeatedly cited the pernicious effects of inflation, particularly for those at the lower-income levels.\nAt the same time, gross domestic product grew at a less-than-expected 1.6% annualized pace in the first quarter, raising concerns over the potential for stagflation with high inflation and slow growth.\n\u201cThe Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent,\u201d the statement said, reiterating language it had used after the January and March meetings.\nIn March, FOMC members penciled in three rate cuts this year, assuming quarter percentage point intervals, and won\u2019t get a chance to update that call until the June 11-12 meeting. \nData also provided by\nGet this delivered to your inbox, and more info about our products and services.\nMost recently, the Labor Department\u2019s employment cost index this week posted its biggest quarterly increase in a year, sending another jolt to financial markets.\nChair Jerome Powell during the news conference following the decision expanded on the idea that prices are still rising too quickly.\nConsequently, traders have had to reprice their expectations for rates in a dramatic fashion. Where the year started with markets pricing in at least six interest rate cuts that were supposed to have started in March, the outlook now is for just one, and likely not coming until near the end of the year.\nSign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox\nOn the balance sheet, the committee said that beginning in June it will slow the pace at which it is allowing maturing bond proceeds to roll off without reinvesting them.\nUnder the new plan, the Fed will reduce the monthly cap on Treasurys to $25 billion from $60 billion. That would put the annual reduction in holdings at $300 billion, compared with $720 billion from when the program began in June 2022. The potential mortgage roll-off would be unchanged at $25 billion a month, a level that has only been hit on rare occasions.\n\u00a9 2024 CNBC LLC.

In late 2021, the Financial Market Supervisory Committee of the Bank of Lithuania ordered Verse Payments Lithuania UAB, the company\u2019s European version of Cash App, to determine the identity of its existing clients whose identities had not been established or had been established out of compliance with the law on Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing. \nMobile payment apps like Cash App, PayPal and Venmo are popular, with over three-quarters of U.S. adults using them, according to a study last year by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. Known as person-to-person payment platforms, the services pose risks to their users and to the financial system, regulators say. In recent years, for example, law enforcement officials have cited criminals\u2019 use of payment apps to evade laws, such as laundering stolen Covid relief funds in 2020.\nCash App is not a bank, but it uses external banking partners to conduct various services. One is Sutton Bank, the small Ohio institution that issues Cash App\u2019s prepaid Visa debit cards, allowing users to spend or withdraw their funds. Banks are required to know every one of their customers, but the Cash App program \u201chad no effective procedure to establish the identity of its customers,\u201d the previous whistleblowers said in their complaints to federal financial regulators.\nProsecutors met with the former employee after NBC News reported in mid-February that two other whistleblowers had told financial regulators about compliance failures at Cash App, the hugely popular mobile payment platform owned by Block. Cash App, introduced in 2013, allows users to send and receive money instantaneously among themselves and to buy stocks and Bitcoin. As of December, Cash App had 56 million active transacting accounts and $248 billion in inflows during the previous four quarters, the company said.\nRoughly 100 pages of documents the former employee provided to NBC News identify transactions, many in small dollar amounts, involving entities in countries subject to U.S. sanctions restrictions \u2014 Cuba, Iran, Russia and Venezuela \u2014 as recently as last year.\nOn March 29, Sutton Bank settled a consent order with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. that echoed the whistleblowers\u2019 allegations. In the order, the FDIC alleged \u201cunsafe or unsound banking practices and violations of law or regulation\u201d at Sutton, including those relating to the Bank Secrecy Act. \nDuring the discussions, the former employee provided prosecutors from the Southern District of New York documents that they say show that insufficient information is collected from Square and Cash App customers to assess their risks, that Square processed thousands of transactions involving countries subject to economic sanctions and that Block processed multiple cryptocurrency transactions for terrorist groups.\nAlong with senior management, the Block board of directors was informed of extensive lapses at the company, the former employee told prosecutors. In recent months, Block has announced the unexpected departures of two directors: Lawrence Summers, the former U.S. treasury secretary and a Block director since 2011, resigned in February, and in April it said Sharon Rothstein, a director since 2022, will not stand for re-election at the company\u2019s annual meeting in June.\nBlock shut down Verse last year. On an earnings call in August, Dorsey said that Verse required significant investment and that its market had \u201cnot seen the growth and profitability we had expected.\u201d\nEdward Siedle, a former Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer who represents the former employee and participated in the discussions with prosecutors, said, \u201cIt\u2019s my understanding from the documents that compliance lapses were known to Block leadership and the board in recent years.\u201d\nIn its response to NBC News, the company said the hiring of the consultant showed Block\u2019s commitment to perform and improve compliance, adding that 50 deficiencies were not unusual given the report\u2019s scope. The former employee\u2019s interpretation of the report misconstrues its findings and their significance, the company said. \nFederal prosecutors are digging into internal practices at Block\n, the financial technology firm launched by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, discussing with a former employee alleged widespread and yearslong compliance lapses at the company\u2019s two main units, Square and Cash App, two people with direct knowledge of the contacts say.\nMost of the transactions discussed with prosecutors, involving credit card transactions, dollar transfers and Bitcoin, were not reported to the government as required, the former employee said. Block did not correct company processes when it was alerted to the breaches, the former employee told prosecutors and NBC News.\nThe company said it believed it had voluntarily reported the \u201cthousands of transactions\u201d described by the former employee to the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, a department of the U.S. Treasury that enforces economic sanctions. But the former employee disputed that, saying thousands of different transactions were not reported.\nAs for Block, it said the Sutton consent order was not likely to affect Cash App\u2019s ongoing business relationship with the bank.\nA second person with direct knowledge of Block\u2019s monitoring programs and practices echoed that assessment; NBC News granted the former employee and the second person anonymity to guard against potential reprisals.\nGot a confidential news tip?

Global Business and Financial News, Stock Quotes, and Market Data and Analysis.\nDuring his time on the board, Summers served on the audit committee, which is charged with reviewing and discussing with management the company\u2019s program and policies on risk assessment and risk management. The committee is overseen by Lord Paul Deighton, a former Goldman Sachs executive who was commercial secretary to the treasury in the U.K. government from 2013 to 2015. NBC News requested interviews with Deighton and Summers, but they declined, forwarding the requests to Block\u2019s corporate communications unit. \nAsked about the probe, a Block spokeswoman provided the following statement: \u201cBlock has a responsible and extensive compliance program and we regularly adapt our practices to meet emerging threats and an evolving sanctions regulatory environment. Our compliance program includes systems, tools, and processes for sanctions screening, as well as investigating and reporting on sanctions issues in accordance with our regulatory obligations. Continually improving the safety and security of our ecosystem is a top priority for Block. We have been and remain committed to building upon this work, as well as continuing to invest significantly in our compliance program.\u201d\nVerse and its former head were fined last year when the Bank of Lithuania inspected Verse and \u201cfound serious and systematic violations of the prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing.\u201d The top Verse executive \u201cdid not ensure the safe and reliable operation of the institution, did not take effective measures to eliminate violations and did not ensure the compliance of the institution\u2019s activities with the established requirements, although information about the violations committed by the institution was known to him for a long time,\u201d the Bank of Lithuania said at the time.\nData also provided by\nCash App\u2019s design increased the risk of compliance lapses, the documents indicate. \u201cDue to the nature of the product,\u201d a document said, \u201ccustomers do not appear to leave stored balances in Cash App very long so our ability to block a stored balance or reject funds is limited.

The consultant identified almost 50 deficiencies in those systems last year, the documents show. \nThe FDIC order cited Sutton Bank\u2019s work with \u201cthird parties\u201d or outside entities and required it to provide details about anti-money-laundering compliance and customer identification programs at the outside companies it works with. The FDIC did not name Cash App in the order, but it is the largest third party that Sutton Bank works with, according to its chief compliance officer. The FDIC order also required Sutton to provide quarterly reporting of \u201cthird-party compliance with legal, contractual, and service level responsibilities, and management actions to address anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism deficiencies.\u201d\nSquare, the other main business unit at Block, is a financial services platform used by millions of merchants. Documents provided to prosecutors and reviewed by NBC News identify instances at Square when it failed to conduct basic customer due diligence on its international merchant sellers and improperly reimbursed some of the merchants\u2019 funds that had been frozen for sanctions violations. (Merchants are considered customers at Square, while users are considered customers at Cash App.) New customers at both Square and Cash App who triggered sanctions alerts at their initial screenings were permitted to conduct transactions before the alerts were resolved, the documents say. They also show instances of employees\u2019 flagging that customer biography information, such as linked social media accounts, was not screened against sanctions keyword lists. \n\u201cFrom the ground up, everything in the compliance section was flawed,\u201d the former employee told NBC News. \u201cIt is led by people who should not be in charge of a regulated compliance program.\u201d \nThe company declined to answer questions about the specific deficiencies cited in the documents. It said that when deficiencies are identified, Block works \u201cwith our in-house legal team, as well as with outside counsel and consultants, to advise us on the issue and appropriate remediation.\u201d The company conducts recurring sanctions screening on all merchants, it said, and its program includes the essential components expected by OFAC.\nOFAC administers and enforces economic sanctions to protect the nation against \u201ctargeted foreign countries and regimes, terrorists and terrorist organizations, weapons of mass destruction proliferators, narcotic traffickers, and others,\u201d according to its website. It \u201cstrongly encourages\u201d companies to develop, implement and routinely update sanctions compliance programs. \u201cSenior management\u2019s commitment to, and support of, an organization\u2019s risk-based sanctions compliance program is one of the most important factors in determining its success,\u201d OFAC says, and it is essential to fostering \u201ca culture of compliance throughout the organization.\u201d\nBlock said that Summers and Rothstein were leaving the board to devote more time to other professional and personal activities and that their departures were not \u201ca result of any disagreements with the company on any matter relating to the company\u2019s operations, policies or practices.\u201d\n\u00a9 2024 CNBC LLC.

By 2060, about 60% of Miami-Dade County will be submerged, estimates Harold Wanless, a professor of geography and sustainable development at the University of Miami.\nThe financial impacts were broad. Among them, 34% couldn\u2019t commute to work, a dynamic that can reduce household earnings, experts said. \n\u201cThis is the view everyone wants,\u201d he said from behind the wheel of a golf cart, as we rolled toward a thin shoreline outcropping of Bermuda grass in The Kampong, a botanical garden in Coconut Grove.

That threatens drinking water and coastal infrastructure, since salt water can eat away certain building materials, Crowl said.\nThe financial threats of such climate disasters are numerous: property damage, higher insurance premiums and medical bills, lost earnings, falling real estate values, declining tourism, forgone business profits and displacement costs such as temporary housing or relocation, among others.\nIndeed, the ultrarich have flocked to South Florida, driving a mansion boom. \nNow, as a precaution, Williams covers his merchandise in plastic when it rains. \nSuch weather is what drew Habibian to the area from New York.\nTwelve massive intake fans are stacked in an open-air hangar adjacent to the Wall of Wind control room.

Together, they help generate top wind speeds of 157 miles per hour.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t leave,\u201d Bustamante said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t leave for anything.\u201d\nThey tout Miami\u2019s stringent building codes and infrastructure enhancements \u2014 such as higher elevation and more permeable ground for new construction, and higher roads and sea walls \u2014 as evidence of its resilience.\nMiami still has the feel of a city under construction as developers scramble to meet housing demand. Cranes pepper the horizon next to the hollow husks of future high rises.\n\u201cWe try to be smart about it, try to be proactive as best we can,\u201d Arditi said of climate risk. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly top of mind.\u201d\n\u201cThis gets worse and worse and worse and worse,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the rub. I think it\u2019s kind of getting close to being too late.\u201d\nSaltwater intrusion is being exacerbated by Miami\u2019s growth.\nSaltwater intrusion was \u201calmost certainly\u201d a contributing factor in the 2021 collapse of a condo building in nearby Surfside, Florida, that killed 98 people, he said. An investigation into the cause of the collapse is ongoing. \nHurricanes can bring about a kind of \u201curban renewal,\u201d meteorologist Erik Salna said from the control room for the Wall of Wind, a facility that simulates the turbulent conditions of a Category 5 hurricane. \nWilliams moved to Miami eight years ago. His business, Dion Atelier, is on the ground floor a few streets from the ocean. \nA large share of recent migration is from California, New York and New Jersey, relatively high-tax states, according to a Miami Realtors analysis.\nIt\u2019s a \u201c3,000-pound gorilla in the room,\u201d Crowl said.\nIn multiple street interviews CNBC conducted with Miami residents, weather was almost universally cited as the top draw.\nDuring big rain storms \u201cthe swell comes up, and the first thing that happens is the whole entire floor terrace floods,\u201d said the proprietor, standing amid neatly styled displays and mannequins draped in high-end fashion. \nInhabitants are drawing increasing amounts of water from freshwater aquifers. The Everglades, which replenishes local aquifers, has lost more than 70% of its water flow over the years, for example. Meanwhile, rising seas push salt water further inland.\nMiami Beach introduced a grant program that offers up to $20,000 per household to incentivize homeowners to reduce their flood risk, Knowles said.\nAs older, outdated dwellings get damaged, destroyed or blown away, new and more expensive buildings remain, he explained.\nDespite that risk, 66% of Miami-Dade County residents said they\u2019d never leave, according to a study published in the journal Climate Risk Management.\nBaraloto estimates just 2% of mangroves are left in the peninsular City of Miami. \nWhile such resilience efforts are helpful, Crowl, the Institute of Environment director, worries about the area\u2019s livability a few decades from now.\nYet people keep moving there. The city\u2019s skyline has grown in tandem. \nThe contradictory forces at play in Miami foreshadow the financial hardship many other Americans will likely face, too.\nA bigger wind facility in development will create maximum speeds of 200 miles an hour. The so-called \u201cCategory 6\u201d project is a recognition of a future with more-intense storms.\nThe Miami metro area \u2014 including Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach \u2014 is a low-lying swath of South Florida that is home to more than 6 million people. \nThe City of Miami issued roughly 10 permits to build new residential and mixed-use buildings in 2014, according to a CNBC analysis of city data.

A lawyer handling Zhuoda Yidu\u2019s bankruptcy and liquidation case referred CNBC to the Tianjin Wuqing District People\u2019s Court for comment. The court did not respond to CNBC.\n\u00a9 2024 CNBC LLC. All Rights Reserved. \nA Division of NBCUniversal\nAs is common in China, the apartment complex in Tianjin sold the units before they were completed. The promise was that they would be ready by 2019, but the majority are still unfinished, according to five of the homebuyers, who spoke to CNBC via telephone but requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation. The buyers are a mix of people who paid in full upfront but also in smaller installments. Their concerns are just one example of the wider challenges that persist in pockets of China\u2019s property sector.\nFor many households, real estate has accounted for the bulk of their wealth, often the result of grandparents and relatives pooling their savings.\nIn a sign of issues with the project early on, the official \u201cTianjin Daily\u201d newspaper reported back in March 2017 that the same Xiyu Garden project constructed by Zhuoda Yidu Investment in the Wuqing district of Tianjin violated the city\u2019s real estate transaction rules by collecting money from buyers without obtaining a license for commercial housing sales. The report said local authorities imposed penalties and ordered rectification. Records accessed via business database Qichacha showed Zhuoda Yidu didn\u2019t get licenses for commercial housing sales until August 2018, although it had received construction permits for part of the project as early as 2016.\nThe developer Zhuoda is far from being one of China\u2019s largest. Some of the homebuyers who spoke to CNBC said that after making initial payments, they found out the property in question was not necessarily a certified project.\nWang said it was the first she\u2019d heard of homebuyers having to pay more to get their finished apartments.\nThe proposal did not offer an alternative, and said the properties must be valued at pre-market slump prices \u2014 or about double or more than the current level, according to comparisons with listed brokerage prices. That\u2019s not to mention eight years of wear and tear, and the possible disruption to the families\u2019 life plans.\nThe document said the apartments could be completed in 2025 or 2026 if the buyers agreed in the next few weeks to pay any outstanding balances on their property purchase, along with other costs as determined by the developer.\nThe real estate sector\u2019s troubles have also weighed on local government finances, which once generated significant revenue from sales of land to developers.\nShe said prior to the Covid-19 pandemic there were sporadic cases of delayed deliveries, especially in cities such as Tianjin, where real estate development surged in 2014 and 2015. She said that at the time local authorities and developers would typically find a solution quickly since it involved a lot of money for an average family.\n\u201cThe money for the down payment was from my dad,\u201d one buyer said of a house bought in 2016. \u201cI can\u2019t tell him it\u2019s not finished. During Covid I told him there were delays. Now Covid is gone and there are no excuses.\u201d\nBeyond China\u2019s recent real estate woes, the homebuyers\u2019 dilemma has its roots in a household registration system \u2014 called hukou \u2014 which dictates where one\u2019s children can attend public school, among other benefits. Cities such as Tianjin have also used hukou policies to attract new residents.\nBEIJING \u2014 A group of around 1,500 homebuyers in the Chinese city of Tianjin, near Beijing, have yet to see \u2014 let alone move into to \u2014 the apartments they said they paid for about eight years ago.\nBut Wang noted an increase in delivery delays after Covid, as developers struggled to keep operating, resulting in a \u201csystemic problem.\u201d\nIn addition to paying in full for that apartment, this one buyer is still paying a monthly mortgage of about 2,800 yuan for a second apartment in the same complex, which was meant for a relative.\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been tricked this whole time,\u201d one buyer said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC.\nSign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox\nGot a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have that much money,\u201d the buyer told CNBC. \u201cIf we had enough money we would be buying in Beijing.\u201d\nInterest in Tianjin and other areas surrounding Beijing surged prior to the pandemic as people working in China\u2019s capital city looked for more affordable housing options at a time when prices were near a peak.\nThe buyers of the Tianjin apartments interviewed for this story said they knew of an unsuccessful effort to get the project on the central government\u2019s list of unfinished homes (which would usually guarantee financing until completion), although it was unclear whether that was due to the project\u2019s certified status. Some saw the latest proposed dispute settlement as a response to central policy changes, since it was a path toward finishing construction instead of leaving the project hanging.\nChina\u2019s Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development and its local unit in Tianjin\u2019s Wuqing district did not provide a comment when contacted by CNBC about this story.\nSome buyers said they had bought the apartments as a place for their parents to retire, or for their children to attend school nearby. In the eight years of waiting to move in, one buyer said one of their parents had died while waiting for the new home, and another said their child had grown up and found another school instead.\nIn one high-profile case, property firm Evergrande defaulted on its debt in late 2021. At the time, the company was the world\u2019s most indebted developer and in the run-up had 1.26 trillion Chinese yuan ($174 billion) worth of projects under construction in 2020 \u2014 about 70% more than the company was able to sell that year, and far more than it actually completed.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just another reflection of how deep the troubles are for the real estate developers,\u201d Dan Wang, chief economist at Hang Seng Bank (China), told CNBC.\nChina\u2019s top leadership said at a meeting in late April they would continue to work to ensure the delivery of homes and protect homebuyers\u2019 interests.\nIn all, Nomura estimated late last year that there are around 20 million unconstructed and delayed pre-sold homes in China.\nThat\u2019s several years\u2019 worth of savings. The average per capita disposable income in 2023 for Beijing city residents was 88,650 yuan, and 51,271 yuan in Tianjin, reflecting the far lower cost of living.\nGet this delivered to your inbox, and more info about our products and services.\nAmong high-income Chinese cities, Tianjin has one of the highest debt levels relative to GDP, according to S&P Global Ratings."}, {"title": "\u2018Big Short\u2019 trader Danny Moses is still betting against Tesla", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/12/big-short-trader-danny-moses-warns-tesla-is-vulnerable-to-70percent-drop.html", "date": "2024-05-12", "text": "\nData is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutes.

Here\u2019s how to reframe it\nThe myth about credit cards and credit scores that\u2019s costing you\nVisa also capped surcharges at 3% in April 2023, down from 4%, the trade group said.\nThere are times when credit cards have distinct advantages to cash, Rust said.\nConsumers are often swayed by cash incentives, even \u201csignificantly likely\u201d to switch to cash payments \u201cspecifically because of cash discounts offered,\u201d according to research by Joanna Stavins, a senior economist and policy advisor at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.\nMore merchants are offering a lower price to customers who use cash rather than credit card for a purchase. That means opting for paper over plastic may save you money in some cases.\nGas stations have long offered cash incentives to customers. But a rising number are now doing so, and \u201csome major retailers are starting to implement the ability to do this in the future,\u201d said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy.\nData also provided by\nMeanwhile, other businesses add a surcharge when customers use credit cards for purchases. In such cases, paying with cash would also yield savings.\nSome big-ticket spending \u2014 like tax bills and college tuition \u2014 is also generally best accomplished with cash, said Schulz. The IRS and many universities pass on payment-processing costs to the consumer. (In these cases, that might mean writing a check.)\n\u201cIf the merchant establishes a discount that\u2019s high enough, even if you have the best rewards card in the world you may still end up paying less if you use cash,\u201d said Adam Rust, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America, a consumer advocacy group.\nBusinesses can take two routes to save money: offering a discount for cash purchases (thereby sidestepping those card fees), or putting a surcharge on credit card transactions to offset those fees.\n\u201cThere are certainly some bigger times when you should probably not use credit cards because of the fees involved,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBy and large, debit cards can be a better and cheaper choice in instances where there\u2019s a credit card surcharge,\u201d Schulz said.\nSometimes, it pays to pay with cash.  \nBusinesses that offer a break on cash purchases generally do so to reduce costs they incur for credit card transactions.\nSurcharges aren\u2019t legal in all states, though.\nWhen a cash discount is offered, the odds increase by 19.2% that a consumer who prefers noncash payments will instead opt to pay with cash, Stavins wrote in a 2018 paper. This research controls for transaction value and merchant type.\n\u201cThe merchant is looking at your dollar and getting 98 cents in the end because you\u2019ve chosen to use a card,\u201d Rust said.\n\u201cSometimes, it can make sense to just go ahead and pay cash,\u201d said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important to understand what the cost of that surcharge is going to be, if there is one, before you go ahead and buy,\u201d Schulz said.\nMeanwhile, more stations are also offering their own payment platform \u2014 like branded debit and credit cards \u2014 that yield even more savings than cash, he added.\nFor example, unlike cash, credit cards carry certain protections related to fraud and product returns, Schulz said.\nThat may be the case even after accounting for credit card rewards, Schulz said. The largest general cash-back return on most credit cards is 2%, for example \u2014 a percentage often exceeded by cash discounts, he said.\nThe trend comes as consumers have steadily shifted away from using cash for purchases: Consumers made 18% of payments with cash in 2022, down from 31% in 2016, according to the Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, credit cards\u2019 share grew to 31% from 18% during that period.\nHowever, that share is up more than 60% from 2015, when 1.8% of all cash transactions had a discount, Atlanta Fed data shows. While not yet the norm, cash incentives are likely to become more widespread, experts said.\nIn addition, small, independent businesses are more likely to offer cash discounts than big national chains, Consumer Federation of America\u2019s Rust said.\nDiscounts are also \u201cvery prevalent\u201d when paying for health care, said Carolyn McClanahan, a certified financial planner and physician based in Jacksonville, Florida.\nData is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutes.

Austin Hurst is one, a former grill master at a Red Lobster in Arizona.

He said he was told his store had been profitable until about 3 months ago.\n\u00a9 2024 CNBC LLC. All Rights Reserved. \nA Division of NBCUniversal\nPrivate equity is emerging in all parts of our economy, Markey added, but its most profound impact is in health care. \u201cThe more private equity gets into the hospital business,\u201d he said, \u201cthe more this is just a preview of coming atrocities affecting our health care system.\u201d\nMore from NBC News:\nAngry that your favorite Red Lobster closed down? Wall Street wizardry had a lot to do with it.\nAsset-stripping occurs when an owner or investor in a company sells off some of its assets, taking the benefits for itself and hobbling the company. This practice is favored among some private-equity firms that buy companies, load them with debt to finance the purchases and hope to sell them at a profit in a few years to someone else. A common form of asset-stripping is known as a sale/leaseback and involves selling a company\u2019s real estate; this type of transaction hobbled Red Lobster.\nIn recent years, private-equity firms have invested heavily in all areas of industry, including retailers, restaurants, media and health care. Some 12 million workers are employed by private equity-backed firms, or 7 % of the workforce. Companies bought out and indebted by private equity go bankrupt 10 times more often than companies not purchased by these firms, academic research shows. In a report this month, Moody\u2019s Ratings said leveraged buyouts like those pursued by many private-equity firms drive corporate defaults higher and reduce the amounts investors recover when the companies are restructured.\nBankruptcies of companies like Red Lobster have a multiplier effect on the overall economy and contribute to a sense of unease among consumers and workers, said Robert Reich, a former labor secretary under President Bill Clinton.\nData also provided by\nThe technique, colloquially known as asset-stripping, has been a part of retail chain failures such as Sears, Mervyn\u2019s and ShopKo as well as bankruptcies involving hospital and nursing home operations like Steward Healthcare and Manor Care. All had been owned by private equity.\n\u201cCarrying a lot of debt and not owning your real estate puts companies at a disadvantage,\u201d said Andrew Park, senior policy analyst at Americans for Financial Reform, a nonprofit and nonpartisan organization advocating for a stable and ethical financial system. \u201cRed Lobster is yet another example of that private-equity playbook of harming restaurants and retailers in the long run.\u201d\nGolden Gate had paid $2.1 billion to buy Red Lobster in May 2014, so the real estate sale was crucial to the firm\u2019s financing. \u201cRed Lobster is an exceptionally strong brand with an unparalleled market position in seafood casual dining,\u201d Josh Olshansky, managing director at Golden Gate, said at the time, a press release announcing the deal shows.\nSen. Edward Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts, where eight hospitals operated by bankrupt Steward Health Care are, recently held hearings on private equity and health care. He has also proposed legislation that would require greater transparency from health care entities owned by private-equity firms, including the disclosure of sale/leaseback arrangements as well as fees collected by the private-equity firm, and dividends paid by the health care entity to the private-equity fund.\nAsked about the negative impact the sale/leaseback had on Red Lobster, a Golden Gate spokeswoman declined to comment.\nRegarding the bankruptcy, a company spokesman provided a statement saying, \u201cThai Union has a been a supplier to Red Lobster for more than 30 years, and we intend for that relationship to continue. We are confident that a court-supervised process will allow Red Lobster to restructure its financial obligations and realize its long-term potential in a more favorable operating environment.\u201d\nData is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutes. Global Business and Financial News, Stock Quotes, and Market Data and Analysis.\n\u201cMy legislation is quite simple,\u201d Markey said in an interview. \u201cTo make sure that these financial shenanigans don\u2019t have a profound impact upon communities across our country, the Department of Health and Human Services has to determine whether or not the sale of the land underneath these hospitals and then having that land rented back to the hospitals isn\u2019t having a negative impact on the provision of health care in that community.\u201d\nThe sale of the Red Lobster stores hurt the company several ways. First, it meant the chain would not benefit from any upside in the commercial real estate market. In addition, the new owner of the real estate did not appear to give Red Lobster good deals on rents. As Red Lobster\u2019s CEO noted in a bankruptcy court filing, \u201cA material portion of the Company\u2019s leases are priced above market rates.\u201d\nAssigning blame for company failures is tricky. But some analysts say the root of Red Lobster\u2019s woes was not the endless shrimp promotions that some have blamed. Yes, the company lost $11 million from the shrimp escapade, its bankruptcy filing shows, and suffered from inflation and higher labor costs. But a bigger culprit in the company\u2019s problems is a financing technique favored by a powerful force in the financial industry known as private equity.\nRed Lobster was America\u2019s largest casual dining operation, serving 64 million customers a year in almost 600 locations across 44 states and Canada. Its May 19 bankruptcy filing and closing of almost 100 locations across the country has devastated its legion of fans and 36,000 workers. The chain is iconic enough to be featured in a Beyonce song.\nThe company that bought the properties, American Realty Capital Partners, got a very good deal, the press release announcing the sale/leaseback said. It characterized the Red Lobster stores it had purchased as \u201cirreplaceable locations\u201d and \u201chigh-quality real estate located at main intersections in strong markets,\u201d but noted the properties were sold \u201cat below replacement cost.\u201d Under the terms of the sale, Red Lobster would also see regular rent increases of 2% a year, the release noted.\nSign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox\nGet this delivered to your inbox, and more info about our products and services.\nThe $1.5 billion sale crippled Red Lobster. After the real estate was sold, Red Lobster had to pay rent on stores it had previously owned, significantly increasing its costs. According to the bankruptcy filing, by 2023 its rents totaled $200 million a year or approximately 10% of its revenues.\nIn 2020, Golden Gate exited its Red Lobster investment, selling to Thai Union Group, a Bangkok-based company, and an investor group. Thai Union calls itself the \u201cworld\u2019s seafood leader\u201d and its brands include Chicken of the Sea tuna products and King Oscar sardines. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.\n\u201cOne of the reasons people feel so insecure is you\u2019ve got in the background, behind the curtain, a lot of these financial games that ultimately are making the very rich richer, and hurting America\u2019s working and middle class,\u201d Reich said in an interview. \u201cAll of the people who were supplying Red Lobster, all of the people who are essentially providing services to Red Lobster, the small businesses in the communities affected by mass layoffs, they are next in line, they are experiencing the ripple effect.\u201d\n\u201cAbout a month before the close, the district manager came in and was like, \u2018Yeah, this Red Lobster is looking really bright. And you guys are going to stay open for sure,\u2019\u201d Hurst recalled. \nAs is typical in private-equity buyouts, Golden Gate\u2019s purchase of Red Lobster significantly increased the chain\u2019s debt, adding higher interest costs to its burden. In 2017, Moody\u2019s Ratings, an independent ratings agency, downgraded Red Lobster to a negative outlook from stable. Moody\u2019s cited the chain\u2019s \u201cpersistently high leverage,\u201d or debt.\nHurst said he was offered a job at another Red Lobster location but it requires a longer commute and pays $17 an hour, down from the $19 he was making before.\nThe sale/leaseback that helped sink Red Lobster involved the July 2014 sale of premium real estate underneath 500 of its stores, which generated $1.5 billion. But that money didn\u2019t go back into Red Lobster; it went instead to the private-equity firm to finance its purchase of the chain, Red Lobster\u2019s press release said. That firm was San Francisco-based Golden Gate Capital, with $10 billion in assets.\nGot a confidential news tip?

JPMorgan\nexecutives at Investor Day said the firm is the largest financier of private-credit portfolios, and it already has dedicated capital on the balance sheet that it uses in a direct-loan format for corporate borrowers. The firm is also developing a co-lending program to boost the amount of capital it can deploy in this space. \nData also provided by\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been investing in the private markets for 30 years; A loan is a loan whether it\u2019s held on a bank balance sheet or held in a private-credit fund,\u201d Arougheti said. \u201d[Ares has] invested $150 billion into the private-credit market since we founded the firm, and we had a loss rate of one basis point. So everything that we\u2019ve seen over the last 30 years would indicate that the risk people are trying to argue exists in our market just isn\u2019t true.\u201d \nThe explosion of private credit has been met with a whole host of concerns, but among the louder ones more recently is that the industry has not experienced a downturn at scale.

On average, they said they would be willing to pay $33.72 more per month.\nConsumers in some states can also opt into green power marketing programs.\nIn short, the answer is yes.\n\u201cThe market does continue to grow every year in terms of sales and customers,\u201d said Jenny Sumner, group manager of modeling and analysis at the NREL.\nExperts recommend choosing a green power option or REC that has been verified by an independent third party.\nThe cost generally exceeds that of a utility\u2019s standard electricity service by about 1 to 2 cents per kilowatt hour, Sumner said.\nJust one in six U.S. adults know that they may have the option to buy renewable power, either from their electric company or another provider, according to the most recent NREL survey data on the topic, published in 2011.\nIn the voluntary market, customers buy renewable energy in amounts that exceed states\u2019 minimum requirements from utility companies. Over half of all U.S. states have policies to raise the share of electricity sourced from renewables, though most targets are years away.\nA growing number of individuals and organizations are opting to shift away from fossil fuels: About 9.6 million customers bought 273 Terawatt hours of renewable energy through voluntary green power markets in 2022, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

It also often comes with a slight price premium, experts said.\nSuch states have \u201ccompetitive\u201d energy markets, meaning consumers can choose from among many different companies to generate their power. But unlike green pricing programs, the company generating the renewable power may not be the customer\u2019s utility, which distributes the power.\nWith \u201ccommunity choice aggregation\u201d programs, local governments buy power from an alternative green power supplier on behalf of their residents.\nFor example, Green-e polices the disclosures energy suppliers make to consumers about renewable energy and verifies that the purchase of that energy isn\u2019t being counted toward state energy mandates, among other things.\nBuying green power can take many forms for residential consumers. What\u2019s available largely depends on their state and local electricity markets.\nOne such independent body is the Center for Resource Solutions, a nonprofit that oversees the Green-e certification standard, the agencies said.\nMost, or 60%, of energy sources came from fossil fuels like coal, natural gas and oil. These energy sources release carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that traps heat in the atmosphere and contributes to global warming.\nThese also tend to come with a premium, though in some regions they \u201cmay be price competitive with default electricity options,\u201d the agencies wrote.\nBuying these certificates separately doesn\u2019t impact a consumer\u2019s existing utility service relationship.\nRenewable energy sources \u2014 including wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal and biomass \u2014 accounted for about 21% of U.S. electricity generation in 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\nPower companies may offer what\u2019s known as green pricing programs.\nJust because a consumer opts for renewable power doesn\u2019t mean the electricity being pumped into their home is coming from those renewable sources.\nSome states have websites where consumers can compare information on energy services, including renewable options, she added.
